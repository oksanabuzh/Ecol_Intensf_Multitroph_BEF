2,Agricultural management intensity determines the strength of weed seed predation,"Daouti, E; Feit, B; Jonsson, M",AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,Carabid species; Agricultural intensity; Poa annua; Arable plants; SEM path analysis,"Agricultural intensification both increases disturbances at the field level and reduces habitat heterogeneity at the landscape level and this can have detrimental effects on biodiversity-driven ecosystem services. A few studies have shown that agricultural intensification can diminish the ecosystem service of weed seed predation, but it is not known to what extent availability of crop and non-crop habitat can provide disturbance refugia for weed seed predators and how those effects cascade to ecosystem service provisioning. Using data from 13 fields in Southern Sweden, we first combined diet preference traits, activity density and metabolic theory, in order to develop a metric that approximates the community strength of seed predation. We then explored how the impact of field management intensity and habitat refugia on seed card predation rates mediated by weed seed availability and the metric of community strength of seed predation. We found that increasing field management intensity directly reduced seed card predation rates and weed seed availability and that reduced weed seed availability in turn impaired the community strength of seed predation. This suggests an indirect mechanism by which field management limits seed predator potential for weed seed predation. We found no evidence that either crop or non-crop refugia can increase seed card predation rates or community strength of seed predation during dis-turbances in the crop. Consequently, weed seed predation can be promoted by reducing disturbances at the field level, regardless of the availability of disturbance refugia in the landscape. Reduction of field management in-tensity can directly increase weed seed predation and indirectly seed predator communities' potential for weed seed predation by increasing weed seed availability. Future research is needed to explore if supporting a diversity of non-competitive weeds to enhance seed availability can improve the suppression of dominant and competitive weed species.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2022.108132,1,Oksana,,No,"No biodiversity, but rather community composition",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fish feeding behavior was assessed by analyzing stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes of fish and natural feed sources. Stable isotope signatures of 45-day-old carp fry introduced into rice plots (delta 13C = - 18.8% +/- 0.5%, delta 15N = 9.3% +/- 0.6%) revealed that they had been fed chicken egg yolk and corn meal, in accordance with local practices. However, after a 100-day growing period in experimental rice plots, C-13 and N-15 depletion was observed for 145-day-old carp, indicating a change in feeding sources. Under extensive conditions, common carp that fed on rice roots, sediments and suspended particulate organic matter (i.e. plant debris and detritus) had a larger trophic niche (3%(2)) than 45-day-old carp (1.2%(2)). Overall, common carp feeding behavior and the trophic food web in the IRF system suggest that increasing natural productivity through organic fertilization will enhance ecological intensification of both rice and fish production.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.738240,2,Oksana,,No,No biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown that conversion of rainforest into plantations erodes biodiversity, but further consequences for food-web structure and energetics of belowground communities remains little explored. We used a unique combination of stable isotope analysis and food-web energetics to analyze in a comprehensive way consequences of the conversion of rainforest into oil palm and rubber plantations on the structure of and channeling of energy through soil animal food webs in Sumatra, Indonesia. Across the animal groups studied, most of the taxa had lower litter-calibrated & UDelta;C-13 values in plantations than in rainforests, suggesting that they switched to freshly-fixed plant carbon ('fast' energy channeling) in plantations from the detrital C pathway ('slow' energy channeling) in rainforests. These shifts led to changes in isotopic divergence, dispersion, evenness, and uniqueness. However, earthworms as major detritivores stayed unchanged in their trophic niche and monopolized the detrital pathway in plantations, resulting in similar energetic metrics across land-use systems. Functional diversity metrics of soil food webs were associated with reduced amount of litter, tree density, and species richness in plantations, providing guidelines on how to improve the complexity of the structure of and channeling of energy through soil food webs. Our results highlight the strong restructuring of soil food webs with the conversion of rainforest into plantations threatening soil functioning and ecosystem stability in the long term.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.75428,4,Oksana,,No,No ecosystem functions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,Landuse Change in Savannas Disproportionately Reduces Functional Diversity of Invertebrate Predators at the Highest Trophic Levels: Spiders as an Example,"Joseph, GS; Mauda, EV; Seymour, CL; Munyai, TC; Dippenaar-Schoeman, A; Foord, SH",ECOSYSTEMS,agriculture; cropland; epigaeic spider species; food security; food web; functional diversity; functional traits; pest control,"Predators play a disproportionately positive role in ensuring integrity of food webs, influencing ecological processes and services upon which humans rely. Predators tend to be amongst the first species to be affected by anthropogenic disturbance, however. Spiders impact invertebrate population dynamics and stabilise food webs in natural and agricultural systems (potentially mitigating against crop pests and reduced yields). Africa's savannas are undergoing continent-wide conversion from low-density rangelands to villages and croplands, as human populations burgeon. Despite limited research, and evidence of deleterious impacts to biodiversity, African savannas are earmarked by prominent international organisations for conversion to cropland. Given the key role of spiders in food webs, they can have beneficial impacts in agroecosystems. Furthermore, functional diversity (FD) reflects ecosystem pattern and processes better than species diversity, so we evaluated impacts of large-scale landuse change on both species richness and FD. We surveyed spiders using pitfall traps at 42 sites (14 replicates each in rangeland, cropland, and villages) in South African savannas, investigating effects of landuse, season, and habitat variables on spider species diversity and FD. Species richness was lowest in villages. FD was lowest in cropland, however, with reduced representation of traits associated with hunting of larger invertebrates. Furthermore, there were fewer specialists in croplands. These findings suggest that even when cropland does not impact species diversity, loss of FD can still occur. As savanna systems transform, impacts on invertebrate population dynamics may increase the possibility of a breakdown in pest control in natural and agricultural systems, given changes in FD of invertebrate predators.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-017-0194-0,5,Oksana,,No,No ecosystem functions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many ecosystem functions depend on the structure of food webs, which heavily relies on the body size spectrum of the community. Despite that, little is known on how the size spectrum of soil animals responds to agricultural practices in tropical land-use systems and how these responses affect ecosystem functioning. 2. We studied land-use-induced changes in below-ground communities in tropical lowland ecosystems in Sumatra (Jambi province, Indonesia), a hot spot of tropical rainforest conversion into rubber and oil palm plantations. The study included ca. 30,000 measured individuals from 33 high-order taxa of meso- and macrofauna spanning eight orders of magnitude in body mass. Using individual body masses, we calculated the metabolism of trophic guilds and used food web models to calculate energy fluxes and infer ecosystem functions, such as decomposition, herbivory, primary and intraguild predation. 3. Land-use change was associated with reduced abundance and taxonomic diversity of soil invertebrates, but strong increase in total biomass and moderate changes in total energy flux. These changes were due to increased biomass of large-sized decomposers in soil, in particular earthworms, with their share in community metabolism increasing from 11% in rainforest to 59%-76% in jungle rubber, and rubber and oil palm plantations. Decomposition, that is the energy flux to decomposers, stayed unchanged, but herbivory, primary and intraguild predation decreased by an order of magnitude in plantation systems. Intraguild predation was very important, being responsible for 38% of the energy flux in rainforest according to our model. 4. Conversion of rainforest into monoculture plantations is associated by an uneven loss of size classes and trophic levels of soil invertebrates resulting in sequestration of energy in large-sized primary consumers and restricted flux of energy to higher trophic levels.

We investigated these structural and functional properties of food webs in stream ecosystems distributed across woodland, agricultural and urban areas in the Zagreb region of Croatia. We compared resource availability and consumer diet composition using stable isotope mixing models and tested how the isotopic variance of basal resources, primary consumers, macroinvertebrate predators and other food web characteristics change with different land-use types. Combination of increased loading and altered composition of nutrients, lower water discharge and higher light availability at urban sites likely promoted the contribution of aquatic macrophytes to diets of primary consumers. Macroinvertebrate predators shifted their diet, relying more on active filterers at urban sites relative to woodland and agricultural sites. Urban food webs also had lower trophic redundancy (i.e. fewer species at each trophic level) and a more homogenized energy flow from lower to higher trophic levels. There was no effect of land use on isotopic variation of basal resources, primary consumers or macroinvertebrate predators, but all these trophic groups at urban and agricultural sites were N-15-enriched relative to their counterparts in woodland stream food webs. The physical and chemical ecosystem characteristics associated with intensive land use altered the resource availability, trophic redundancy and the flow of energy to other trophic levels, with potentially negative consequences for community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. These empirical findings indicate that reducing nutrient pollution, agricultural runoffs and maintaining riparian vegetation can mitigate the impacts of land use on structure and function of stream ecosystems.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12955,7,Oksana,,No,"Not agricultural ecosystem, streams",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Management of lowland mesotrophic grasslands in north-west Europe often makes use of inorganic fertilizers, high stocking densities and silage-based forage systems to maximize productivity. The impact of these practices has resulted in a simplification of the plant community combined with wide-scale declines in the species richness of grassland invertebrates. We aim to identify how field margin management can be used to promote invertebrate diversity across a suite of functionally diverse taxa (beetles, planthoppers, true bugs, butterflies, bumblebees and spiders). 2. Using an information theoretic approach we identify the impacts of management (cattle grazing, cutting and inorganic fertilizer) and plant community composition (forb species richness, grass species richness and sward architecture) on invertebrate species richness and body size. As many of these management practices are common to grassland systems throughout the world, understanding invertebrate responses to them is important for the maintenance of biodiversity. 3. Sward architecture was identified as the primary factor promoting increased species richness of both predatory and phytophagous trophic levels, as well as being positively correlated with mean body size. In all cases phytophagous invertebrate species richness was positively correlated with measures of plant species richness. 4. The direct effects of management practices appear to be comparatively weak, suggesting that their impacts are indirect and mediated though the continuous measures of plant community structure, such as sward architecture or plant species richness. 5. Synthesis and applications. By partitioning field margins from the remainder of the field, economically viable intensive grassland management can be combined with extensive management aimed at promoting native biodiversity. The absence of inorganic fertilizer, combined with a reduction in the intensity of both cutting and grazing regimes, promotes floral species richness and sward architectural complexity. By increasing sward architecture the total biomass of invertebrates also increased (by c. 60% across the range of sward architectural measures seen in this study), increasing food available for higher trophic levels, such as birds and mammals.",2009,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01675.x,9,Oksana,,No,No ecosystem functions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alongside reductions in local species diversity, biotic homogenization at larger spatial scales is of great concern for conservation. Biotic homogenization means a decrease in beta-diversity (the compositional dissimilarity between sites). Most studies have investigated losses in local (alpha)-diversity(1,3) and neglected biodiversity loss at larger spatial scales. Studies addressing beta-diversity have focused on single or a few organism groups (for example, ref. 4), and it is thus unknown whether land-use intensification homogenizes communities at different trophic levels, above-and belowground. Here we show that even moderate increases in local land-use intensity (LUI) cause biotic homogenization across microbial, plant and animal groups, both above- and belowground, and that this is largely independent of changes in alpha-diversity. We analysed a unique grassland biodiversity dataset, with abundances of more than 4,000 species belonging to 12 trophic groups. LUI, and, in particular, high mowing intensity, had consistent effects on beta-diversity across groups, causing a homogenization of soil microbial, fungal pathogen, plant and arthropod communities. These effects were nonlinear and the strongest declines in beta-diversity occurred in the transition from extensively managed to intermediate intensity grassland. LUI tended to reduce local alpha-diversity in aboveground groups, whereas the alpha-diversity increased in belowground groups. Correlations between the alpha-diversity of different groups, particularly between plants and their consumers, became weaker at high LUI. This suggests a loss of specialist species and is further evidence for biotic homogenization. The consistently negative effects of LUI on landscape-scale biodiversity underscore the high value of extensively managed grasslands for conserving multitrophic biodiversity and ecosystem service provision. Indeed, biotic homogenization rather than local diversity loss could prove to be the most substantial consequence of land-use intensification.",2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature20575,11,Oksana,,No,No ecosystem functions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a rapid ecosystem function assessment (REFA), we approximated predation by quantifying predation attempts on artificial sentinel prey. Dummies were placed on the soil surface of 83 managed temperate grasslands across a broad range of land-use intensities (grazing intensity, mowing frequency, and the amount of applied fertiliser) in two regions of Germany. Additionally, we measured vegetation height and assessed the abundance of ground-dwelling arthropods using pitfall traps. We documented predation marks left by arthropods, rodents, and birds. The proportion of dummies with predation marks (i.e. predation rates) differed between regions. Vegetation height was the strongest predictor for predation in our study but correlated only weakly with land use. Predation rates increased with increasing vegetation height, for rodents and for all predator groups combined. All three land-use components affected predation, which was most prominent for arthropod predation. Arthropod predation increased with higher grazing intensity and decreased with higher mowing frequency and higher fertilisation intensity. Also, the abundances of ground-dwelling arthropods affected predation. While predation rates generally increased with a higher abundance of carabids and decreased with higher abundance of ants, the effects of spider abundance interacted with region. Our results demonstrate that different components of land use can have counteracting effects on predation rates acting together with changes in the abundance of different predator groups and vegetation height. This suggests that land-use practices that sustain high vegetation and ground-dwelling predator abundances increase predation rates in grasslands and consequently the potential to provide ecosystem services in the form of pest control.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2018.10.015,13,Oksana,,No,No biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relationship between predator community composition and predation rates of pests remains poorly investigated. A deeper understanding of the processes shaping interaction strength in agroecosystems is needed if we are to accurately predict natural pest control services. Functional traits in a community can provide insights into processes shaping community assembly and ecosystem functioning. Functional diversity indices can be constructed from a single trait, such as body length, or from the integration of multiple traits, such as body length, hunting mode and habitat preference. However, their performance in predicting ecosystem functioning and services remains largely unexplored. We used empirical data replicated at landscape scales to examine which component of ground-dwelling predator community structure (activity-density, species richness, evenness, taxonomic distinctness and functional diversity) of spiders, carabids and staphylinids best predicted predation rates of aphids in spring cereals. Functional diversity explained a greater part of variation in predation rates than any other taxonomic or activity-density component. Among the indices for functional diversity, single-trait indices better predicted variation in aphid predation rates compared with multiple-trait indices. In particular, we found that the community-average value of body-size of ground-dwelling predators was negatively related to predation rates of aphids, whereas the proportion of spiders with a preference for arable land was positively related to predation rates. Additional analyses of body-size distributions of ground-dwelling predators suggested that intraguild predation was a key process shaping the relationship between predator community composition and the level of aphid pest control. Considering the functional trait composition of communities provides a more mechanistic understanding of the processes shaping the strength of trophic interactions in terrestrial ecosystems, thus improving predictive power.

However, their performance in predicting ecosystem functioning and services remains largely unexplored. We used empirical data replicated at landscape scales to examine which component of ground-dwelling predator community structure (activity-density, species richness, evenness, taxonomic distinctness and functional diversity) of spiders, carabids and staphylinids best predicted predation rates of aphids in spring cereals. Functional diversity explained a greater part of variation in predation rates than any other taxonomic or activity-density component. Among the indices for functional diversity, single-trait indices better predicted variation in aphid predation rates compared with multiple-trait indices. In particular, we found that the community-average value of body-size of ground-dwelling predators was negatively related to predation rates of aphids, whereas the proportion of spiders with a preference for arable land was positively related to predation rates. Additional analyses of body-size distributions of ground-dwelling predators suggested that intraguild predation was a key process shaping the relationship between predator community composition and the level of aphid pest control. Considering the functional trait composition of communities provides a more mechanistic understanding of the processes shaping the strength of trophic interactions in terrestrial ecosystems, thus improving predictive power. Body-size distribution and habitat preference appear to be particularly valuable in predicting the level of natural pest control by ground-dwelling predators in an agroecosystem.",2015,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2015.02.003,14,Oksana,,Yes,NA,field observation,Crop production systems (treatment: no treatment (observation); BEF - is the focus; no land use tests),Biodiversity effects (observational),Predator diversity,Predator diversity,predator diversity,BEF,predation/parasitism,predation,predation rate,predation,predation rates of aphids using predator exclusion treatments,service,rate,rate,3,"AG, BG","herb, woody sp., tree canopy, soil ",NA,NA,No,NA,indirect,via land use,"3,4",predators,2nd_cons,ground-dwelling predatory arthropods,invertebrates,arthropods,"spiders, carabids and staphylinids",functional,distance-based indices,diversity,neutral,P-value,Table 2,NA,No,No,NA,NA,NA,No,NA,NA,No,NA,methodological,biodiversity measure,depands on biodiversity measure,croplands,conventional spring barley fields,Europe,Sweden,Sweden (province of Scania in southern Sweden),56 N,1330' E,"No management tests, no habitat complexity tests (via traits only)"

33,Effects of grazing management on biodiversity across trophic levels-The importance of livestock species and stocking density in salt marshes,"van Klink, R; Nolte, S; Mandema, FS; Lagendijk, DDG; WallisDeVries, MF; Bakker, JP; Esselink, P; Smit, C",AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,Cattle; Horses; Plants; Birds; Butterflies; Flower-visiting insects; Vegetation; Wetland,"European coastal salt marshes are important for the conservation of numerous species of specialist plants, invertebrates, breeding and migratory birds. When these marshes are managed for nature conservation purposes, livestock grazing is often used to counter the dominance of the tall grass Elytrigia atherica, and the subsequent decline in plant species richness. However, it remains unclear what is the optimal choice of livestock species and stocking density to benefit biodiversity of various trophic levels. To fill this knowledge gap, we set up a triplicate, full factorial grazing experiment with cattle and horse grazing at low and high stocking densities (0.5 or 1 animal ha(-1)) at the mainland coast of the Dutch Wadden Sea. Here, we present the results after 4 years and integrate these with previously published results from the same experiment to assess effects of livestock grazing on various trophic groups. Stocking density affected almost all measured variables: high stocking densities favoured plant species richness and suppression of E. atherica, whereas low stocking densities favoured abundances of voles, pollinators and flowers. Densities of different functional groups of birds showed no significant response to the regimes, but tended to be somewhat higher under 0.5 horse and 1 cattle ha(-1). Choice of livestock species had fewer and smaller effects than stocking density. Horse grazing was detrimental to vole density, and showed an interactive effect with stocking density for Asteraceae flower abundance. Multidiversity, a synthetic whole-ecosystem biodiversity measure, did not differ among regimes. These results are discussed in the light of other results from the same experiment. Because of these contrasting effects on different trophic groups, we advise concurrent application of different grazing regimes within a spatial mosaic, with the inclusion of long-term abandonment. High density horse grazing, however, is detrimental to biodiversity.

These transition zones may offer rather inhospitable habitats that could jeopardise biodiversity. On the other hand, transition zones are also reported to be hotspots for biodiversity and even evolutionary processes. The general mechanisms and influence of processes in transition zones are poorly understood. Although heterogeneity and diversity of land use of fragments and the transition zones between them play an important role, most studies only refer to forested transition zones. Often, only an extrapolation of measurements in the different fragments themselves is reported to determine gradients in transition zones. In this article, we analyse environmental gradients and their effects on biota and matter dynamics along transects between managed continental temperate forests and agricultural land for one year. Accordingly, we found S-shaped microclimatic gradients in transition zones of 50-80 m between arable lands and forests. Aboveground biomass was lower within 65 m of the transition zone, 30 m in the arable land and 35 m in the forest. Soil carbon and nitrogen contents were elevated close to the transition zone's zero line. This paper contributes to a quantitative understanding of agricultural landscapes beyond individual ecotopes, and towards connected ecosystem mosaics that may be beneficial for the provision of ecosystem services.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2019.01.001,17,Oksana,,No,"No biodiversity, no management",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extensively managed field margins can help protect this functional biodiversity by providing habitat for beneficial species. 2.This 2year study investigated the relative benefits of grassland field margin treatments (Fenced only, Rotavated, and Reseeded (with a grass and wildflower mixture)) on the abundance and taxon richness of five arthropod trophic groups (detritivores, herbivores, predators, parasitoids and hyperparasitoids) from the orders Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera and Araneae. 3.The taxon richness and abundance of all trophic groups (with the exception of herbivore abundance) was greater in fenced field margin treatments than in the adjacent grazed field, particularly by the final sampling occasion. However, there were seasonal differences, with abundance and taxon richness generally greater in August than in June. Only detritivores and herbivores responded to the individual fenced field margin treatments. The botanically more species rich, rotavated and reseeded treatments, had greater detritivore and herbivore richness and abundance than the fenced only treatments. 4.Community structure analysis indicated that the grazed (within) field and fenced field margins had two distinct communities for all trophic groups, demonstrating the conservation value of the margins within intensively managed agricultural grasslands. 5.The current Irish agri-environment scheme requires fencing of field margins. Our results highlight how this relatively simple measure can benefit arthropod conservation and functional biodiversity. This may in turn benefit farm productivity through potentially improved nutrient cycling and natural pest control.",2013,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-4598.2012.00203.x,18,Oksana,,No,No ecosystem functions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

43,Diversity and functional structure of soil animal communities suggest soil animal food webs to be buffered against changes in forest land use,"Pollierer, MM; Klarner, B; Ott, D; Digel, C; Ehnes, RB; Eitzinger, B; Erdmann, G; Brose, U; Maraun, M; Scheu, S",OECOLOGIA,Forest management; Disturbance; Structural equation modelling; Soil pH; Invertebrates,"Forest soil and litter is inhabited by a diverse community of animals, which directly and indirectly rely on dead organic matter as habitat and food resource. However, community composition may be driven by biotic or abiotic forces, and these vary with changes in habitat structure and resource supply associated with forest land use. To evaluate these changes, we compiled comprehensive data on the species composition of soil animal communities and environmental factors in forest types varying in land-use intensity in each of three regions in Germany, i.e., coniferous, young managed, old managed, and unmanaged beech forests. Coniferous forests featured high amounts of leaf litter and low microbial biomass concentrations contrasting in particular unmanaged beech forests. However, soil animal diversity and functional community composition differed little between forest types, indicating resilience against disturbance and forest land use. Structural equation modelling suggested that despite a significant influence of forest management on resource abundance and quality, the biomass of most soil fauna functional groups was not directly affected by forest management or resource abundance/quality, potentially because microorganisms hamper the propagation of nutrients to higher trophic levels. Instead, detritivore biomass depended heavily on soil pH. Macrofauna decomposers thrived at high pH, whereas mesofauna decomposers benefitted from low soil pH, but also from low biomass of macrofauna decomposers, potentially due to habitat modification by macrofauna decomposers. The strong influence of soil pH shows that decomposer communities are structured predominantly by regional abiotic factors exceeding the role of local biotic factors such as forest type.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-021-04910-1,21,Oksana,,No ,No ecosystem functions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44,"Seeds in farmland food-webs: Resource importance, distribution and the impacts of farm management","Evans, DM; Pocock, MJO; Brooks, J; Memmott, J",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,Agro-ecosystems; Ecological networks; Habitat modification; Spatial temporal distributions,"Whilst considerable research effort in Europe has linked agricultural intensification with dramatic declines of seed-feeding birds, surprisingly little is known about the wider importance of seeds in animal food-webs. Moreover, understanding the dynamics of farmland seed food resources for species of conservation concern is of considerable research interest. We examined the distribution of berries and soil-surface seeds in the managed and unmanaged habitats of a 125 ha organic farm. We took soil suction-samples over a year, counted and identified all seeds, and compared abundances and species-richness between habitats. We constructed ecological networks from literature records and by rearing insects to investigate the importance of these seeds for insects, birds and mammals. We predicted the impacts of management on seed biomass, energy and the ecosystem service of pest control across the whole farm. We estimated seed and berry food resources of up to 33 metric tons of biomass and 560 GJ of energy on the farm. Potentially, more than 330 species use the seeds as a food resource, the overwhelming majority of which are invertebrates (82%) relying predominantly on non-crop and weed species. Generally, uncultivated semi-natural habitats such as woodland and mature hedgerows were more species-rich and had higher seed biomass and energy than crop habitats throughout the year, but fallow land was disproportionately important for seeds during the summer. Models of increased management intensity revealed declines of up to 19% in seed biomass and energy and cascades through the network that resulted in a substantial decrease in potentially pest-controlling parasitoids.

Existing studies, however, have provided inconsistent results and have generally focused on only a few trophic groups or a few levels of plant diversification. Using field data from banana agroecosystems and structural equation modelling, we assessed (i) the effects of plant species richness (two height strata) and soil cover (% of living plant cover and% of litter cover) on a multitrophic arthropod food web, (ii) the links among five trophic groups of arthropods (detritivores, herbivores, non-ant omnivores, omnivorous ants, and predators) and (iii) the effect of natural enemies on the abundance and the damage of the banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus. Plant species richness of low strata (< 1.5 m high) had a positive bottom-up effect on herbivore prey abundance, which in turn enhanced the abundance of non-ant omnivores and of predators. Litter cover promoted the abundance of detritivore prey, which in turn enhanced predators and omnivorous ants. The latter two trophic groups were negatively related to weevil damage and probably reduced damage by consuming weevil eggs and larvae. Finally, on the basis of our results, we suggest how the plant community and soil cover within the field could be managed to enhance ecological regulation of the banana weevil.",2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2017.08.009,23,Oksana,,Yes,NA,field observation,Agroforestry (treatment: diversification of plants; no land use tests),Biodiversity effects,Plant diversity,Crop diversity,crop diversity,Biodiversity (as management tool),herbivory,herbivory,herbivory rate,herbivory,% damage of banana corn with weevil,disservice,rate,rate,2,AG,herb,NA,NA,Yes,NA,indirect,via land use,1,plants,plants,plants,plants,plants,plants,species,richness,richness,negative,P-value,"Fig. 2, Fig. 3",NA,NA,No,NA,NA,NA,No,No,NA,Yes,litter cover,No,No,NA,croplands,banana plantations,North America,Costa Rica,Costa Rica (Reserve of Talamanca),900?950?

However, it is not completely understood how belowground animal contribution to these functions changes in grasslands subject to different land use types. A microcosm experiment was carried out to test the effect of a tritrophic food chain on CO2 release from grassland soils. Soil was collected from three differently managed grassland systems (meadow, pasture, and mown pasture) located in three distinct German regions that cover a north-south gradient of approximately 500 km. The tritrophic food chain comprised natural edaphic microflora, nematodes, and predatory gamasid mites. The experimental design involved a full factorial combination of the presence and absence of nematodes and gamasid mites. Nematodes significantly increased the CO2 emissions in most treatments, but the extent of this effect varied with land use type. The fact that grazing by nematodes stimulated the metabolic activity of the edaphic microflora over a wide range of grassland soils highlighted the critical impact of the microfauna on ecosystem services associated with soil organic matter dynamics. Gamasids slightly amplified the effect of nematodes on microbial metabolic activity, but only in the pastures. This effect was most probably due to the control of nematode abundance. The fact that gamasid addition also augmented the impact of environmental conditions on nematode-induced modulation of soil respiration highlighted the need for including land use differences while evaluating soil fauna contribution to soil processes. To conclude, the differential response of the investigated tritrophic food chain to different grassland management systems suggests that adverse effects of land use intensification on important soil processes such as atmospheric C-release could potentially be reduced by using management methods that preserve essential features of the belowground food web.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1002-0160(18)60008-6,24,Oksana,,Yes,NA,microcosm/mesocosm experiment,Land use intensity (meadow -> pasture -> mown pasture),Land use intensity,Management intensity,Grassland management (combined),"grazing, mowing",NA,decomposition,decomposition,soil respiration,soil respiration,CO2 (soil microbial respiration),service,flux,flux,2,BG,soil,negative,No,Yes,predator addition,direct,direct,"3,4",predators,2nd_cons,predators,invertebrates,arthropods,Gamasida,food web,top troph. level presence,top troph. level presence,positive,P-value,"Fig. 2, table 2",NA,NA,No,NA,NA,NA,No,NA,NA,Yes,"soil pH, soil water-holding capacity, soil organic C",land use factors,land use,"land use type ( increase with meadow, mown pasture, and pasture)",grasslands,"meadow, mown pasture, and pasture",Europe,Germany,Germany (Biodiversity Exploratories),,,No management tests

Here, we assessed the impact of conversion from arable cropland to Miscanthus and Short Rotation Coppice (SRC) willow in UK bioenergy commercial plantations on earthworm community structure and abundance. At this same location we then conducted an in-situ (CO2)-C-13 pulse-chase labelling experiment in the two bioenergy plantations to trace the fate of recently photosynthetically assimilated carbon into roots, bulk soil, soil microbial (PLFA) and earthworm communities. Results showed that land conversion from annual arable crops to both Miscanthus and SRC willow perennial bioenergy crops led to severe reductions of soil earthworm abundance and biomass. SRC willow had higher microbial biomass relative to Miscanthus, whereas Miscanthus provided a better habitat for a more functionally diverse earthworm community. Transfer of labile C compounds to soil pools was faster under Miscanthus supporting activity of bacterial grazers in the soil food chain, whereas a fungal-driven detrital decomposition processes dominated under SRC willow plantations. Taken together, these findings indicate that plant identity in land conversions have a strong influence not only on the abundance and structure of soil communities but also on which basal resources (root exudates, dead organic matter or microbial derived compounds) are preferentially consumed, and ultimately on the rates of mobilisation of these different C pools.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2019.107603,27,Oksana,,No,"No biodiversity, too complex to extract any results, analysed for each site separately",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While grassland ecosystem responses to grazing have been extensively studied, few studies have focused on the effects of aboveground herbivores on belowground diversity and functions. In this work, we quantified effects of grazing on the structure, function and dynamic stability of soil food webs. We sampled a long-term grazing manipulation in a semi-arid shortgrass steppe (USA Great Plains) at sites showing contrasting soil textures. Treatments included native steppe plots that have been moderately grazed since 1939 paired with plots totally protected from grazing since 1996. We sampled our plots for soil C and N, and for soil biota, separated microbes and micro- and mesofauna in trophic functional groups and defined trophic relationships. We used models to estimate carbon and nitrogen mineralization, energy flow throughout the food web, interaction strengths between trophic groups at steady-state and, eventually, asymptotic (near-equilibrium or local) stability (Moore and de Ruiter, 2012). Soil food web response to grazing depended on soil texture and organic matter content. In our food webs, most energy flowed through the fungal and bacterial detritus-based channels (sensu Moore and Hunt, 1988). There was a clear asymmetry between the amount of energy flowing through each of the two channels and, the higher this asymmetry, the higher was food web stability. Stability was affected by both grazing and soil properties (increased under grazing in high clay soils with high organic matter content but decreased in less organic loam sandy soils), and positively associated with soil organic matter content. Overall, we found that the carbon flow through the soil food web of the shortgrass steppe is responsive to grazing in ways that altered stability and that structural, functional, and dynamic attributes are sensitive parameters for evaluating soil response to land use under changing scenarios.

Arabuko-Sokoke Forest, one of the Important Bird Areas (IBAs) in Kenya, is under threat due to ongoing land use change in the surroundings that could affect species composition of many bird guilds. However, information on the response of different guilds in tropical land use systems is sparse in Africa. We examined the effects of land use on bird guilds in primary forest (Arabuko-Sokoke Forest), adjoining plantations, and neighbouring farmland. Point counts were distributed equally in the three land use systems to survey bird populations. A total of 2600 bird observations was recorded, representing 97 species in five main feeding guilds (frugivores, nectarivores, insectivores, carnivores, and granivores). Granivores were most abundant and diverse in farmland, while carnivores (primarily raptors) utilised all habitats. Insectivores were most diverse in primary forest where vertical heterogeneity of the vegetation and the presence of large fruiting trees significantly influenced their occurrence. Specialist nectarivores were most frequent in primary forest, whereas occasional nectarivores were less abundant there. Contrary to expectation, frugivore diversity showed no significant effect of land use.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01584197.2018.1431052,29,Oksana,,No ,No ecosystem functions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, such systems differ greatly from annual cropping systems in terms of spatio-temporal dynamics and levels of disturbance. Identifying how land use changes at different scales affect communities and ecosystem services in those habitats is of major importance. Our objectives were to examine the effects of local and landscape agricultural intensification on ground beetle community structure and weed seed predation services. We examined the effects of local vegetation management and landscape context on ground beetle community structure and weed seed predation in 20 vineyards of southwestern France in 2013 and 2014. Vineyards were selected along a landscape complexity gradient and experienced different management of local vegetation. The activity-density of ground beetles decreased with increasing landscape complexity while species richness and evenness remained unchanged. Phytophagous and macropterous species dominated ground beetle communities. Seed predation was positively related to the activity-density of one species, Harpalus dimidiatus, and was not affected by local management or landscape context. We found that within-year temporal diversity in ground beetle assemblages increased with landscape complexity. Our study shows that increasing the proportion of semi-natural habitats in vineyard landscapes enhances the temporal diversity of ground beetles. However, we also found that measures targeting specific species delivering biological control services are a reasonable strategy if we are to maximize natural pest control services such as weed seed regulation to support crop production and reduce agrochemical use.",2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-016-0390-x,30,Oksana,,Yes,NA,field observation,Land use intensity (local agricultural intensification: low intensity  (grass cover + no soil tillage) vs high intensity (soil tillage + half  grass cover)),Land use intensity,Management intensity,Cropland management (combined),"tillage, cover crop cover",NA,herbivory,weed control,weed seed predation,weed seed predation,% of removed seed,service,rate,rate,2,AG,soil surface,neutral,No,No,NA,indirect,via land use,2,herbivores,1st_cons,seed herbivores,invertebrates,arthropods,ground beetles,species,richness,richness,neutral,AIC,text,neutral,No,No,NA,NA,NA,"Yes, as management",NA,NA,Yes,resourse (weed) species,biotic properties of study system,consumer taxa,species-specific,croplands,vineyards,Europe,France,France (Bordeaux),,,Temporal variation in community composition increased with landscape complexity

Seeds from different weed species were offered through exclusion experiments at different distances from the weedy field borders, inside maize (2005) and wheat (2006) stubbles with contrasting land use in the neighbor fields (annual crop fields vs. seminatural grasslands), and inside seminatural grasslands adjacent to stubbles. Canopy structure was characterized inside the wheat stubbles, and small mammals were sampled in both stubble crops and grasslands. All weed species were predated in both 2005 and 2006 trials, but predation ratios varied among weed species, partly due to their seed size, with larger ones being more preferred. While in the maize stubbles no distance or neighbor field land use effects, or interactions between the different factors were detected, in the wheat stubbles, influence of neighbor field land use on weed species predation varied according to distance from field border and the height of the stubble canopy. In wheat stubbles adjacent to annual crop fields, predation increased with canopy height at every different distance from the field borders (5 m, 30 m and 60 m). The opposite was found in wheat stubbles adjacent to seminatural grasslands, where seed predation sharply decreased with canopy height, except for the farthest distance to the border. Capture results suggest a predominance of Calomys spp. populations in crop areas (stubbles adjacent to annual crops) which contrasted with the more diverse small mammal's community of the grasslands. Based on these data, we provide an insight into the hierarchical nature of factors affecting the predation of weed seeds and discuss some implications of land use patterns on the regulation of weed populations by small vertebrates.

Exotic fast-growing species are selected as pioneer species for restoration in degraded hilly lands of southern China. To better understand the potentials of the soil nematode trophic group composition in carbon sequestration, we investigated nematode trophic groups in Acacia, Eucalyptus, and Schima (native species as control) monoculture plantations in southern China after 23 years of reforestation. Our results showed that although total soil nematode abundance was not affected, the Acacia plantation significantly altered nematode trophic group composition over native species. Bacterivore and microbivore abundance, trophic diversity, and microbivore-driven soil organic carbon storage were higher in Acacia mangium than Schima superba. In contrast, plant parasitic nematode abundance and fungivore/bacterivore ratio were lower in Acacia mangium than Schima superba. As a result, Acacia mangium as a fast-growing pioneer tree species could be widely planted to maintain soil biodiversity and store carbon in restoring degraded forests in southern China. Eucalyptus exserta plantation enlarged the soil nematode community, including bacterivores, fungivores, and herbivores, suggesting that there is almost no allelopathy when eliminating anthropogenic disturbance in this study. Reasonable management is crucial for providing timber products and improving the ecological function of Eucalyptus plantations. Our results also highlight the critical roles of soil water and nutrient availability in regulating soil nematode trophic group composition and carbon sequestration.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.15244/pjoes/77031,33,Oksana,,No ,No ecosystem functions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We summarize information on the 51,496 potential trophic links, which were established using information on diet specificity and species traits that typically constrain feeding interactions (trophic group, body size, and vertical stratification).

In addition to the impacts of these chronic stressors, occasional mass mortality events may have severe consequences on ecosystem services and biodiversity. In this study, we examined the impact of a mass mortality event of the clam (Austrovenus stutchburyi) on an estuarine food web and the grazing pressure exerted by the bivalve population. In February 2009, c. 60% of the clam population died in Whangateau Harbour, New Zealand. Population clearance rate calculations suggest that the clam population do not exert significant top-down control on phytoplankton biomass in the estuary, and thus the impact of the mortality event on bivalve grazing pressure was less severe than the reduction in abundance would suggest. A trophic model shows that phytoplankton play a limited role in the estuary food web, which is instead dominated by microphytobenthos and clams. This study highlights the importance of microphytobenthos in shallow estuaries, and the application of the trophic model is a useful tool that can identify key components of the ecosystem and could help inform monitoring programmes.",2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.2016.1245200,38,Oksana,,No ,"Not agricultural ecosystem, estuaries",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, several countries still view GM crops with trepidation, citing potential risks to human health and the environment. We currently know little about how non-target biota responds to cultivation of GM crops under field conditions. This study describes a series of microcosm and field experiments in Ontario, Canada, that estimated the effects of transgenic, glyphosate-tolerant (GT) crops and their management on the abundances of detritivorous soil biota and crop litter decomposition. Absolute abundance of few of the measured biotic groups were affected by either the herbicide or variety treatments and, where significant effects were observed, the responses were not consistent across all years or for all sample dates within a year. More frequently, but not consistently, the GT herbicide system was associated with increased fungal : bacterial biomass ratios, suggesting a state of reduced enrichment. Although the conventional and GT varieties studied differed in composition, we observed few effects of the modification for glyphosate-tolerance on maize Zea mays and soybean Glycine max litter decomposition. Overall, the herbicide system associated with GT crops reduced soybean- and corn-litter decomposition, but responses were inconsistent across Ontario, with many trials demonstrating no effect. Effects were probably underrepresented in this study as average daily precipitation was positively correlated with the magnitude of this system effect and many sites received well-below average levels of precipitation. Synthesis and applications. Most concerns regarding the potential impacts of GM crops on non-target biota have targeted traits associated with the biotechnology itself. However, shifts in management practices associated with biotechnology are also widespread and have the same, if not greater, potential to alter the structure and functioning of agroecosystem biodiversity. The lack of observed permanent negative effects on soil biota in this study is heartening; however, more research is required to determine the functional consequences of observed transient effects and effects on other biota, as well as how altered crop litter decomposition affects agroecosystem nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration.",2009,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2009.01617.x,39,Oksana,,No,No biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73,Responses of soil micro-food web to long-term fertilization in a wheat-maize rotation system,"Zhang, ZY; Zhang, XK; Xu, MG; Zhang, SQ; Huang, SM; Liang, WJ",APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY,Microbial community; Nematode community; Long-term fertilization; Metabolic footprint; Structural equation modeling; Wheat-maize rotation,"Soil microbes and nematodes are important components of soil biota that strongly affect agricultural productivity and sustainability. Currently, our knowledge on the response of soil biota to agricultural management is restricted. This study aimed to identify the relationship between microbial and nematode communities and explore the resource path that flows within the soil micro-food web under different fertilization practices in a winter-wheat/summer-maize rotation system. The experiment was a randomized complete block design with three replicates for each treatment that included unfertilized control; inorganic N, P and K fertilizer (NPK); NPK plus manure; and NPK plus maize straw. Soil samples were taken at a 0-20 cm depth when wheat and maize were harvested. The results showed that organic manure or maize straw combined with NPK fertilizers had positive effects on the soil microbial and nematode communities. For example, the incorporation of straw increased the fungal biomass. Longterm inorganic fertilization might restrain nematode biomass accumulation especially in fungivorous nematodes. The analysis of the metabolic footprints of nematodes suggested that the incorporation of straw could enhance the carbon resource flow into the soil food web by enhancing nematode biomass. Structural equation modeling analysis suggested that the bottom-up control from the microbial community to the nematode community was more obvious in the wheat season in comparison with the maize season. In addition, a relatively stronger predation relationship was found between omnivores-predators and bacterivores rather than fungivores. Our study suggests that organic management combined with NPK fertilization could effectively enhance the association between microbial and nematode communities, while a crop rotation system with maize may have a negative influence on the structure of the soil micro-food web.

74,Decline in forest bird species and guilds due to land use change in the Western Himalaya,"Shahabuddin, G; Goswami, R; Krishnadas, M; Menon, T",GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,Degraded; Deforestation; Urban; Avifauna; Monoculture; Oak,"Land use change is the most widespread driver of biodiversity loss in densely populated tropical countries. Biodiversity loss, in turn, results in changes in functional guilds responsible for various forest ecosystem services. It is thus necessary to understand the extent and types of biodiversity loss and functional guild alteration caused by land use change in order to facilitate sustainable land use policies. Here we study the effects of land use change on forest bird species and guilds in a human-dominated landscape in the Western Himalaya, India. We carried out systematic breeding-season surveys in six land use types within moist temperate forest: natural (protected) oak forest, degraded (lightly used) oak forest, lopped (heavily used) oak forest, pine forest, cultivation and built-up sites, in two adjoining landscapes, over two consecutive years. Our study shows moderate to drastic species loss in all modified land use types in comparison to natural oak forest. Species composition in modified land use types diverged significantly from natural oak; this effect was highest in cultivation and built-up sites and least in degraded forests. Compositional change in modified land uses occurred due to partial replacement of forest specialists with commensals and open country species, whereas abundance of forest generalists was relatively constant across the gradient. We also find a steep decline in the abundance of functional guilds such as pollinators, and insectivorous pest controllers in all modified land uses in comparison to natural oak forest. Our results have important implications for conservation in biodiverse mountain landscapes with significant human imprint. In particular, (a) low faunal diversity in monocultures and urban sites (b) drastic (50% loss or more) loss of forest specialists, pollinators and insectivores in degraded forests, monocultures and urbanised sites; and (c) the potential for degraded forest as refugia for forest species, are findings that can be globally applied to land use and conservation planning in human-dominated landscapes.

In this study the detrital soil food webs of three temperate sandy ecosystems have been compared in the attempt to quantify the extent to which anthropogenic action affects them. The structure of the corresponding food webs was analysed and their topological robustness was calculated through the use of a dynamic model, which is briefly introduced. Our Alteration Index has been used here for the first time to enable a direct comparison between different food-web architectures. The results show that all soil networks have a disassortative nature, as expected for theoretical food webs. The values of the clustering coefficient, of the connectance and of the complexity, together with the calculation of the robustness suggest that the fallowed pasture with low pressure management is more robust than the other two grasslands under middle intensity management. The robustness shown by ecological networks could be useful elsewhere for evaluating the sustainability of agricultural practices to which the soil system is subject.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109079,42,Oksana,,No ,No ecosystem functions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed variations in stable isotope ratios (15N/14N and 13C/12C) of fertilizers, plants, prey and generalist predators in organic and conventional farming systems in a long-term agricultural experiment [DOK trial (bioDynamic, bioOrganic, Konventionell)]. Two basal resources with pronounced differences in carbon isotope signatures, wheat litter (C(3) plant) and maize litter (C(4) plant), were used to uncover differences in food web properties between the two farming systems (conventional versus organic). Predators incorporated significantly higher proportions of carbon from wheat sources in organically managed fields, suggesting that they were more closely linked to wheat-consuming prey in this system. The delta 15N values of three predaceous species were more than 2 parts per thousand greater in summer than in spring. The results obtained suggest that generalist predators consumed higher proportions of herbivore prey in the organic system and that starvation and intraguild predation rates increased in some predator species with time. Because the effects of farming system and sampling date on predators were species-specific, conserving a diverse natural enemy community including species with different phenologies and sensitivities to management practices may, in the long term, be a good strategy for maintaining high pest suppression throughout the growing season.",2011,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-9563.2010.00511.x,43,Oksana,,No ,No ecosystem functions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To assess the degree to which it affects the balance between two interactions of opposite sign, namely seed dispersal and post-dispersal seed predation, we selected 16 patches of chestnut forest in O Courel and El Bierzo, northwestern Spain. We assessed the effect of fragmentation over two different seed dispersal-predation systems using Helleborus foetidus and Ilex aquifolium as model species. In the first case, field experiments consisted of seed-offering trays with selective exclusion of rodents and ants in a two-way orthogonal design. In the second experiment, we placed experimental branches and trays on the floor to assess seed dispersal and predation. The interactions between several fragment traits and the relative contribution of rodents, ants and birds to seed removal were analyzed by means of generalized linear mixed models. Results show that for H. foetidus, differences in seed dispersal-predation were accounted for by patch shape, which affected mainly the dispersal phase. Major seed dispersal took place in patches with a smaller edge to core ratio and high plant cover (abandoned patches), whilst the latter also showed maximum seed predation. For I. aquifolium, fragmentation effects were significant only for seed predation, which was increased in abandoned patches. This shows that the effects of habitat fragmentation can emerge at different phases depending on specific traits of the interacting animals. It also highlights the importance of traditional land-use practices in species interactions.",2011,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-011-0846-z,44,Oksana,,No,No biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We employed high-throughput sequencing of environmental DNA, targeting the V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene, to characterize changes in their abundance, species richness, and community structure with conversion of lowland rainforest into rubber agroforest (jungle rubber), and rubber and oil palm plantations; typical agricultural systems in Sumatra, Indonesia. We identified 5,204 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% identity threshold of protists from 32 sites. Protists species richness was similar in rainforest, jungle rubber and oil palm plantations but significantly lower in rubber plantations. After standardization, 4,219 OTUs were assigned to five trophic groups, and inspected for effects of land-use change, and potential biotic and abiotic driving factors. The most abundant trophic group was phagotrophs (52%), followed by animal parasites (29%), photoautotrophs (12%), plant parasites (1%), and symbionts (<1%). However, the relative abundance and OTU richness of phagotrophs and photoautotrophs increased significantly with increasing land-use intensity. This was similar, but less pronounced, for the relative abundance of symbionts. Animal and plant parasites decreased significantly in abundance and species richness with increasing land-use intensity. Community compositions and factors affecting the structure of individual trophic groups differed between land-use systems. Parasites were presumably mainly driven by the abundance and species richness of their hosts, while phagotrophs by changes in soil pH and increase in Gram-positive bacteria, and photoautotrophs by light availability. Overall, the results show that relative species richness, relative abundance, and community composition of individual trophic groups of protists in tropical lowland rainforest significantly differ from that in converted ecosystems. This is likely associated with changes in ecosystem functioning. The study provides novel insight into protist communities and their changes with lan-duse intensity in tropical lowland ecosystems. We show, that trophic groups of protists are powerful indicators reflecting changes in the functioning of ecosystems with conversion of rainforest into monoculture plantations.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00240,45,Oksana,,No ,No ecosystem functions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We measured seed and invertebrate predation rates using trays placed in front of 32 wildlife cameras in 16 cereal fields with a local habitat contrast (8 fields adjacent to another crop field and 8 fields adjacent to a semi-natural grassland) and along a landscape heterogeneity gradient (amount of semi-natural grassland). Both activity and predation were dominated by small mammals (mainly rodents), yet only a few species contributed to predation services and disservices according to camera records. Small mammal activity and predation varied considerably over time. Small mammal activity was significantly higher at trays with crop seeds or beneficial invertebrate prey compared to trays with pest prey, and crop seed predation by small mammals was significantly higher than weed seed predation. In contrast, bird activity and predation did not differ significantly between resource types, but varied over time depending on the habitat contrast. Predation of animal prey by birds was highest after cereal harvest, independent of habitat contrast.

Organisms atop trophic chains are particularly sensitive to disturbance, especially when they are dependent on a specific trophic resource subject to strong fluctuations in density and quality, which is the case of parasitoids. We investigated the (1) variability in spatiotemporal relative abundance patterns of a cereal aphid parasitoid community, determining at what scales such patterns vary in agrosystems. We also investigated whether (2) parasitoid relative abundances are strongly influenced by host relative abundances and if (3) different host species are exploited at distinct rates. Aphid parasitoid populations were monitored in three remote agricultural regions in France between 2010 and 2012. Five parasitoid species (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiinae) and three aphid species (Hemiptera: Aphididae) were identified in each of those three regions. Fields sampled in one region in a single year exhibited similar relative abundance patterns, with aphid parasitoid communities varying across regions and years. All parasitoid species were able to exploit each monitored host species. Metopolophium dirhodum Wlk was consistently a more frequent species among parasitized aphids than among living aphids, indicating that this aphid species was exploited at a higher rate than the other two aphid species found (Sitobion avenae F and Rhopalosiphum padi L). Those findings suggest the cereal aphid-parasitoid network is not strictly determined by the intrinsic permanent environmental characteristics but partially varies from one year to another. The similarity in abundance patterns in different fields of a region in a given year suggests the existence of a mechanism allowing a rapid synchronisation of the relative abundance patterns at an intra-regional scale. This phenomenon could be useful in predicting host-parasitoid communities and bear important consequences for the ecosystem service provided by parasitoids.",2015,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/ES15-00010.1,48,Oksana,,No,No biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper provide an empirical evidence for the food-web complexity-ecosystem properties relationships using the comparative analysis of food webs in seven mountain pastoral grasslands located in the Carpathian Mountain area of the Chernivtsi Region, Ukraine. Biomass of plant functional groups; grazing intensity; richness of different functional groups of the soil microorganisms; and geographical location of the study grasslands are observed ecosystem properties. Trophic networks consisting of N food and feeding categories (nodes, compartments) joined by L food transfers (links) were constructed for each studied pasture and the following network measures of their graph characteristics (topology) determined: food-web size (N), number of links (L), link density (LD = L/N), and connectance (C= L/N-2). Also the number of trophic classes and size of each trophic class are incorporated as the properties of the food-web architecture. Our data reveal that increase in species richness and food-web complexity increases the biomass of forbs within the study grasslands. Grazing intensity shows negative but statistically insignificant correlation with network measures. Our findings also reveal the longitudinal changes in connectance variation across the study food webs. It shows that temperature and elevation changes may also contribute toward the food-web connectance variation within the study area. Overall, our findings report plants to be the defining in network architecture. Furthermore grazing-susceptible plants show to be the driving variable in a food-web structure of the study grasslands. Our findings also reveal new aspects in behavioral patterns of food-web properties in relation to each other. Our data report link density to be the most sensitive parameter in relation to the other food-web measures. In contrast, connectance shows the least sensitivity to all other network measures, but the most sensitivity to the observed ecosystem parameters. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The addition of cover crops increases the primary productivity of the system and diversifies basal resources for higher trophic levels. How increases in the quality and quantity of basal resources affect bottom-up and top-down control remains a key question in soil food web ecology. We evaluated the response of the nematode community to the introduction of cover crops between rows of a banana plantation. We measured changes in nematode food web structure and inferred the prevalence of bottom-up and top-down effects on the abundance of phytophagous nematodes (i.e., plant-feeding and root-hair-feeding species) 1.5 years after plots with cover crops (Poaceae or Fabaceae species) or bare soil were established. The addition of a cover crop greatly affected the structure and the abundance of the soil nematode community 1.5 years after planting. The abundance of all trophic groups except for plant-feeding nematodes tended to increase with the addition of cover crops. The Shannon Weaver diversity index and the enrichment index increased with the addition of cover crops, indicating that opportunistic, bacterivorous and fungivorous nematodes benefited from the added resources. Plant-feeding nematodes were least abundant in plots with Poaceae cover crops, while bacterivorous, omnivorous, and root-hair-feeding nematodes were more abundant with Fabaceae cover crops than with bare soil, indicating that cover crop identity or quality greatly affected soil food web structure. Bottom-up effects on all trophic groups other than plant-feeding nematodes were evident with Poaceae cover crops, suggesting an top-down control of plant-feeding nematodes by omnivorous nematodes. Conversely, plant-feeding nematodes were evidently not suppressed in Fabaceae cover crops, perhaps because bottom-up effects on omnivorous nematodes were weaker (hence, top-down control by omnivorous nematodes was weaker), and because Fabaceae cover crops probably served as good hosts for some plant-feeding nematodes.

86,Crop tree release increased the density of soil nematodes and improved the food web structure,"Yin, HF; Su, Y; Li, XW; Fan, C; Chen, G; Feng, MS; Liu, SZ; Guo, MJ; Li, XJ; Chen, YQ; Wu, DY",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH,disturbance; Pinus massoniana; soil environment; soil nematode community; trophic groups.,"As a special thinning method, crop tree release (CTR) has a beneficial effect on forest environments and structures by changing forest light, heat, and water. However, the impact of CTR on underground biodiversity remains unclear. Therefore, we analyzed the composition, diversity, and metabolic footprints of soil nematode communities under three CTR (100, 150, and 200 trees.ha(-1)) treatments, as well as a no CTR treatment, in Pinus massoniana Lamb. plantations. The results showed that CTR increased the density of soil nematodes (P < 0.05), the number of omnivore-predator nematodes (P < 0.05), and the diversity (H') of nematodes (P < 0.05) and enriched the food web structure of soil nematodes. In the medium CTR density treatment (150 trees.ha(-1)), the nematode density and diversity (H') were the highest (P < 0.05), the number of omnivore-predator nematodes was also the highest (P < 0.05), and the enrichment index and structure index values of the soil nematodes reached the maximum at the depth of 0-10 cm (P < 0.05).

Reliable monitoring methods are essential for tracking the status of ecosystem services. Predation is the mainstay of natural pest control, a key ecosystem service. We used green plasticine caterpillars to monitor predation pressure, and to obtain baseline data on predator activity in transgenic Bt versus non-Bt maize fields in Old and New World countries. Predation pressure was measured at ground and canopy levels using an identical, small-plot experimental design in four European countries (Denmark, Slovakia, Romania and Italy) and Argentina. Total predation rate in maize was 11.7%d(-1) (min. 7.2%d(-1) in Argentina, max. 29.0%d(-1) in Romania). Artificial caterpillars were attacked both by invertebrates (mostly chewing insects with 42.0% of the attack marks, and ants with 7.1%, but also predatory and parasitoid wasps, spiders and slugs), and vertebrates (small mammals 25.5%, and birds 20.2%). Total predation at ground level (15.7%d(-1)) was significantly higher than in maize canopies (6.0%d(-1)) in all countries, except Argentina. We found no significant differences between predator pressure in Bt versus non-Bt maize plots. The artificial caterpillar method provided comparable, quantitative data on predation intensity, and proved to be suitable for monitoring natural pest control. This method usefully expands the existing toolkit by directly measuring ecological function rather than structure.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1744-7917.12550,52,Oksana,,No,No biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
88,Decreasing predation rates and shifting predator compositions along a land-use gradient in Madagascar's vanilla landscapes,"Schwab, D; Wurz, A; Grass, I; Rakotomalala, AANA; Osen, K; Soazafy, MR; Martin, DA; Tscharntke, T",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,conservation; dummy caterpillars; ecosystem functioning; land-use history; Madagascar; predation; shifting cultivation; vanilla agroforestry,"Land-use change is the main driver of deforestation and land degradation resulting in the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in north-eastern Madagascar. Vanilla, the region's main cash crop, is grown in agroforestry systems and may provide an opportunity for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We used dummy caterpillars to assess predation rates and predator communities along a land-use gradient including unburned old-growth and forest fragments, herbaceous and woody fallows after shifting cultivation with fire usage, as well as rice paddies. The studied vanilla agroforests were either forest-derived or fallow-derived. Besides land-use type, we considered the effects of land-use history (unburned/burned), plot-level parameters and the landscape composition to conclude on management recommendations. Old-growth forest and forest fragments exhibited highest predation rates, which decreased with land-use intensity. Overall, predation was higher in unburned land-use types than in more open, previously burned habitats and rice paddies. High stem and vegetation densities were positively related to predation rates, but decreased with land-use intensity. High forest cover in the surrounding landscape led to higher predation rates, while local structural parameters remained more important. The predator community was arthropod-dominated across all land-use types with ants responsible for between 33% and 69% of all predation events. Overall predator composition in old-growth and forest fragments differed from all other land-use types. Predation by Gryllacrididae (Orthoptera) was lower in all land-use types, including forest-derived vanilla, than in old-growth forest and forest fragments, where they were important contributors to total predation. Vertebrate predation was low throughout. Synthesis and applications. Forested habitats feature higher predation rates and different predator compositions than other land-use systems. Maintaining or restoring tree- and understorey-rich vanilla agroforestry represents a viable tool in landscape conservation programmes as it has the potential to contribute to the conservation of predation as an important ecosystem function in both forest- and fallow-derived agroforests. However, vanilla agroforestry has limited value in conserving forest-specialized predator communities. While the establishment of tree-rich agroforests on former fallow land is favourable for conservation ecosystem functioning, further forest transformation should be avoided.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13766,53,Oksana,,No,No biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
89,Testing the Paradox of Enrichment along a Land Use Gradient in a Multitrophic Aboveground and Belowground Community,"Meyer, KM; Vos, M; Mooij, WM; Hol, WHG; Termorshuizen, AJ; van der Putten, WH",PLOS ONE,,"In the light of ongoing land use changes, it is important to understand how multitrophic communities perform at different land use intensities. The paradox of enrichment predicts that fertilization leads to destabilization and extinction of predator-prey systems. We tested this prediction for a land use intensity gradient from natural to highly fertilized agricultural ecosystems. We included multiple aboveground and belowground trophic levels and land use-dependent searching efficiencies of insects. To overcome logistic constraints of field experiments, we used a successfully validated simulation model to investigate plant responses to removal of herbivores and their enemies. Consistent with our predictions, instability measured by herbivore-induced plant mortality increased with increasing land use intensity. Simultaneously, the balance between herbivores and natural enemies turned increasingly towards herbivore dominance and natural enemy failure. Under natural conditions, there were more frequently significant effects of belowground herbivores and their natural enemies on plant performance, whereas there were more aboveground effects in agroecosystems. This result was partly due to the boom-bust'' behavior of the shoot herbivore population. Plant responses to herbivore or natural enemy removal were much more abrupt than the imposed smooth land use intensity gradient. This may be due to the presence of multiple trophic levels aboveground and belowground. Our model suggests that destabilization and extinction are more likely to occur in agroecosystems than in natural communities, but the shape of the relationship is nonlinear under the influence of multiple trophic interactions.

However, a limited number of studies have investigated the impact of disturbance by invasive pathogenic species and succession on arthropod predator-prey food-webs in forest ecosystems. Hymenoscyphus fraxineus is a pathogenic fungus of ash trees that is invasive in Europe and causes massive dieback, mainly of the common ash Fraxinus excelsior across its native range. Here we investigated how this pathogenic fungus affects food-webs of web-building spiders and their prey in understorey vegetation of ash plantations. In 23 young and middle-aged ash plantations that were distributed along a gradient of infestation by H. fraxineus (29%-86% infestation), we measured the vegetation structure (canopy openness, shrub coverage, herb/grass coverage), the trait composition of local spider communities (web type, body size), the prey availability and the prey intercepted by spider webs. We then evaluated the multivariate prey composition (prey type, body size) and network properties. Hymenoscyphus fraxineus opened the ash tree canopy, which resulted in denser shrub coverage. The dense shrub vegetation changed the composition of web types in local spider communities and increasing fungus infestation resulted in reduced mean body size of spiders. Infestation by H. fraxineus reduced the availability of predaceous Coleoptera and increased the availability of herbivorous Coleoptera as potential prey. The mean body size of captured prey and the per capita capture rates of most prey groups decreased with increasing fungus infestation. Hymenoscyphus fraxineus infestation indirectly reduced the complexity in bipartite networks and the trophic functional complementarity in local web-building spider communities. The plantation age affected the vegetation structure but did not affect the studied food-webs. Forest disturbance by the invasive pathogen affected four trophic levels (plant-herbivore-coleopteran intermediate predator-top predator web-building spiders) and, contrary to the disturbance-succession theory, disturbance by the fungus simplified the web-building spider-prey food-webs.

We investigated how non-crop habitats in one AES influence seed-eating ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) and post-dispersal weed seed predation, an ecosystem service provided by these beetles. We found that the abundance of beetles was higher in the non-crop habitats than within the crop fields. Species diversity (measured by Simpson's D), however, was greater in crop fields than in non-crop habitats. In addition, beetle assemblages were distinct between the crop and non-crop habitats possibly clue to differences in the frequency and intensity of disturbance between crop and non-crop habitats. Seed predation by small predators (mainly ground beetles) was greater in the non-crop habitat than within the potato field. Moreover, we found a positive association between seed predation and beetle diversity both within the crop and in the non-crop habitat which provides evidence of a relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem services. Yet. differences in species assemblages suggest that species identity also affects rates of seed predation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

As parasitoids are important parasitic natural enemies of wheat aphids, their interactions with wheat aphids have received much attention. Traditional methods commonly cannot provide clear evidence of trophic links between primary parasitoids and hyperparasitoids or multiparasitism. To overcome this problem, we developed a molecular approach including three multiplex PCRs and five singleplex PCRs. With this approach, four wheat aphid species, four primary parasitoid species and eight to nine hyperparasitoid species were detected from aphid samples, which covered all the primary parasitoids and 94.8-98.1% of the hyperparasitoids found in wheat fields of northern China. The trophic interactions between aphids and primary parasitoids and between primary parasitoids and hyperparasitoids were determined, and a quantitative tri-trophic food web was established through molecular detection. The proportion of hyperparasitized samples was 53.36%, and multiparasitism was very common in the hyperparasitoid trophic interactions (22.02%). These results indicate that this approach is effective for revealing the complex wheat aphid-parasitoid-hyperparasitoid networks in northern China.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/entomologia/2020/1009,58,Oksana,,No ,Method paper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, few studies distinguish between the effects of habitat loss and isolation, or how multiple ecosystem services may be affected simultaneously. We investigated the effects of variation in cover of woody and open semi-natural habitats and isolation from forest on the relative functioning of pollination, seed predation and insect scavenging in agricultural landscapes. We established 30 sites in grassland locations in the Swiss plateau around Berne. The sites varied independently in their isolation from forest edges, in the percentage of woody habitats and in the percentage of open semi-natural habitats in the surrounding landscape (500 m radius). We experimentally exposed primroses, sunflower seeds and cricket corpses during spring 2008. None of the three studied services was affected by variation in woody or open semi-natural habitat cover. However, the proportion of flowers setting seed was significantly reduced by isolation from forest. Further, seed predation and insect scavenging were significantly lower at isolated sites than at sites connected to woody habitat. This pattern was particularly pronounced for seeds and insect corpses that were enclosed by wire netting and thus inaccessible to vertebrates. Thus, all three studied services responded quite similarly to the landscape context. The observed small-scale determination of seed set, seed predation and insect scavenging contrasts with larger-scale determination of pollination and insect pest control found in other studies.",2009,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-009-9376-2,59,Oksana,,No,No biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to investigate the role of biodiversity in the relationships between wildflowers, relative pollinators and their crab spider predators, six wildflower communities, characterized by a different botanical complexity, were sown in a two-year experiment. The selected Mediterranean species flowered between March and September, with a peak during May. The indices of dominance (D) and biodiversity (H') of the wildflower communities confirmed two expected levels of floristic complexity of the oligo-specific plant communities (only three species) in comparison to the poly-specific wildflower communities (a further 20 species for each oligo-specific plant community). The greater floristic biodiversity facilitated a greater pollinator biodiversity (bees, solitary bees, bumblebees, lepidoptera, diptera syrphidae and bombyliidae) but the respective total visitation rate was unchanged. In the case of the lower floristic complexity (oligo-specific plant communities), the dominance of bees increased, confirming their tendency to always choose the same wildflower species to visit. The evaluation of the crab spiders detected on flowers, waiting for pollinators, showed a significant reduction in the case of additional botanical complexity. Indeed, significant linear regressions (p < 0.05) showed a direct relationship between the number of crab spiders observed and the dominance indices of the various wildflower communities. The paper also discusses the possible ecological role of crab spiders in the biodiversity sustainability of the various wildflower communities.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109272,60,Oksana,,Yes,NA,manipulative field experiment,Diversification of wildflower corridors in croplands (treatment: diverse vs low diverse wildflower corridors in croplands; no land use tests),Biodiversity effects,Plant diversity,Crop diversity,wildflower diversity in corridors ,Biodiversity (as management tool),pollination,pollination,pollination rate,pollination rate diversity,flower visitation rate by different groups,service,rate,rate,2,AG,herb,NA,NA,Yes,plant diversity (2 levels),direct,direct,1,plants,plants,plants,plants,plants,plants,species,richness,richness,positive,P-value,Table 4,NA,NA,No,NA,NA,NA,No,NA,NA,No,NA,No,No,NA,croplands,wildflower corridors in croplands of wheat and maize,Europe,Italy,Italy,4340? 39?

Recent evidence supports the hypothesis that stable rhizospheres of perennial crops can favor the occurrence of EPNs. However, different agricultural management practices can modulate their natural distribution in agroecosystems, hence should be considered in conservation biological control programs to support as high as possible native EPN populations. Cultivated olive (Olea europaea subsp. europaea), originally from the Mediterranean Basin, is a key perennial crop susceptible to a diverse range of arthropod pests that account for their life with at least one soil inhabitant stage. In this study, we investigated, for the first time, the occurrence of EPNs and associated soil organisms in olive groves managed with different practices. We surveyed 89 commercial olive groves located in Andalusia (Southern Spain) and differently handled for pest management (conventional vs. organic), soil management (tilling vs. cover cropping), and irrigation regime (rain feed vs. drip-irrigation). By using species-specific primers-probe sets and quantitative real-time PCR approaches, we screened the occurrence of nine species of EPNs, five free-living nematodes (FLNs), and six nematophagous fungi (NF). We found EPNs in 23.6% of the sites, identifying only two EPN species: Steinernema feltiae (15.7%) and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (7.9%). Pest and soil management did not affect EPN abundance, but drip irrigation increased their occurrence (P < 0.025). On the contrary, we recorded lower FLN numbers in irrigated groves (P = 0.003), particularly for Oscheius tipulae and Pristionchus maupasi. Regarding NF, both organic management (P < 0.001) and drip irrigation (P < 0.035) enhanced their abundance. Four abiotic explanatory variables (extractable P, clay content, elevation, and precipitation) explained 85.6% of the EPN, FLN, and NF species variation in multivariate analysis. Overall, drip irrigation in the olive groves enhanced the EPN community but also NF growth, natural enemies of nematodes. Additional studies are required to determine the best combination of alternative strategies that will enhance a balanced soil biota in olive groves in Mediterranean regions and other areas where this crops is cultivated that enable conservation ecosystem services, such as those provided by the EPNs.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2022.108070,61,Oksana,,No,No biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
102,Ecological intensification in multi-trophic aquaculture ponds: an experimental approach,"Jaeger, C; Aubin, J",AQUATIC LIVING RESOURCES,IMTA; fishponds; planted lagoon; common carp; nitrogen; phosphorus,"As aquaculture production is increasing considerably, it needs to become more environment-friendly. Based on a participatory process, an ecologically intensive pond system was designed to test three hypotheses: a combination of intensive and extensive areas provides more ecosystem services than an intensive or extensive area alone; coupling a planted lagoon with an intensive pond decreases the latter's environmental impacts and maintains or increases its fish productivity; and using formulated feed in polyculture increases growth of all fish species. To test these hypotheses, we designed a specific integrated multi-trophic aquaculture system composed of a polyculture of common carp (Cyprinus carpio), roach (Rutilus rutilus) and tench (Tinca tinca) and a lagoon planted with macrophytes to filter the water. This pond system was compared with extensive (unfed) and semi-intensive fishpond systems without a planted lagoon. We measured fish growth performances, water quality, chlorophyll concentrations and water and sediment nutrient contents. We also calculated the mass balance of nutrients. Concentrations of total nitrogen and phosphorus increased in sediments, indicating that nutrients were stored in the ponds, especially in planted lagoon; the planted lagoon decreased phytoplankton development, and limited blooms, but it slightly decreased fish growth performances compared to those in semi-intensive fishponds. The formulated feed supplied clearly increased fish growth performances and the survival rate, and seemed also to increase the use of available nutrients in ponds, which improved the production of overall fish biomass. In conclusion, the planted lagoon provides ecosystem services on nutrients cycling and habitat for natural biodiversity. Improving knowledge about nutrient cycles from formulated feed within the pond food web would be useful to increase the amounts of nutrients converted into fish biomass.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/alr/2018021,62,Oksana,,No,No biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
103,Development of soil food web of microbes and nematodes under different agricultural practices during the early stage of pedogenesis of a Mollisol,"Li, N; Pan, FJ; Han, XZ; Zhang, B",SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,Soil food web; Soil nematode guild; Soil microbial community; Soil formation; Soil restoration; Soil resilience,"Agricultural practices such as tillage and organic amendment influence development of the soil food web. However, such effects are not well understood at the initial stage of soil formation. Using an eight year field experiment established on exposed parent materials of a Mollisol, the objectives of this study were: (1) to determine the effects of agricultural practices on soil food web structure in comparison to the structures of soil nematode guilds and microbial communities, per se; (2) to elucidate the development of the food web of the young soils in relation to parent materials and a mature Mollisol; and (3) to identify the controlling factors of such relationships. The microbial biomass expressed in phospholipid fatty acids and the abundance of nematode guilds increased in the field treatments compared with parent materials by a larger magnitude in Gram positive (G+) bacteria and plant parasite (PP) nematodes under perennials than under cropping. The abundance of bacterivorous (Ba) nematode guilds was significantly correlated with microbial biomass of total bacteria, but not with that of G+ or G bacteria. The abundance of total Ba, particularly Ba1 nematode guilds was positively correlated with soil organic carbon and its related nutrient contents. Redundancy analysis showed that the structure of food web was similar to nematode guild structure rather than to soil microbial community structure among the soils. The food web structure was separated between the soils under perennials and those under cropping via Axis 1 and between fertilized and not fertilized soils irrespective of land uses via Axis 2. The separations via Axis 1 were mainly driven by PP nematodes in association with high C:N soils, suggesting the determinant effect of land use type, while the separations via Axis 2 were driven by Ba nematodes and bacteria in association with soil physical and chemical properties, indicating the role of soil carbon and nutrients. The food web in the arable soils with more organic amendments was similar to that of mature Mollisol. These findings suggest that soil food web at the early pedogenesis can develop quickly with restoration practices and the development was more affected by land use type than by soil management practices.

104,Addition of crop residues affects a detritus-based food chain depending on litter type and farming system,"Sereda, E; Wolters, V; Birkhofer, K",BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY,,"The addition of crop residues is a common farming practice to increase the organic carbon content of agricultural soils with particular importance in organically managed crops. Residues can be added either from the crop plant itself or from other plants and the type of litter may differentially affect decomposer populations. Effects of litter addition may cascade up to affect generalist predators via trophic cascades or modifications of structural microhabitat properties with unknown consequences for the role of these predators in below- and aboveground food webs. Wheat and maize litter were added to organically and conventionally managed wheat fields and effects on generalist predator and Collembola numbers, litter decomposition and carbon utilization as estimated by stable isotope analysis were studied, Significantly more predators were sampled in plots with maize litter compared to plots with wheal litter and under organic farming. Collembola numbers were not significantly affected by litter type or farming system.. Litter mass loss was highest in plots that received wheat litter under organic management and was negatively related to predator, but not Collemhola numbers. :Individuals of Lepidocyrtus spp. (Collembola) incorporated high percentages of maize-borne carbon compared to predator species. Two linyphiid spider species were more closely linked to the maize-consuming prey in organically managed fields and one carabid species showed this pattern in conventionally managed fields. High litter decomposition levels and generalist predator numbers were only observed in wheat litter plots in organically managed fields. The addition of crop residues from the growing crop under organic management may therefore be a promising farming practice to simultaneously promote decomposition services and numbers of natural enemies. Future studies need to address this practice and potential effects on the litter decomposer predator food chain across sites that cover a range of different soil types and climatic conditions.",2015,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2015.07.005,64,Oksana,,No,No biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
105,Effects of shrimp-farm effluents on the food web structure in subtropical coastal lagoons,"Serrano-Grijalva, L; Sanchez-Carrillo, S; Angeler, DG; Sanchez-Andres, R; Alvarez-Cobelas, M",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,Anthropogenic stress; Coastal lagoons; Ecosystem ecology; Gulf of California; Stable isotopes; Trophic relationships,"Although numerous studies have reported the negative effects of shrimp aquaculture on water quality, little is known about the ecological effects of these practices in coastal lagoons and near-shore marine habitats. The impact of shrimp-farm effluents on the food webs of an impacted subtropical coastal lagoon in the Gulf of California was evaluated through measurements of isotopic (delta C-13, delta N-15) signatures in sediments, plants and animals, and compared with the results of a near-pristine reference site. Degradation was manifested in a strong reduction on fish diversity at the perturbed site. delta C-13 signatures provided ambiguous evidence of degradation while delta N-15 was a better descriptor of shrimp-farm effluent impact on coastal lagoon food webs. The site receiving nutrient-rich discharges showed significant enrichment of delta N-15 (approximate to 5 parts per thousand) in sediments, macroalgae, benthic algae, filterfeeders and omnivorous feeders, resulting in qualitative differences in foodweb structure between both lagoons. The food web in the perturbed site was sustained by sediment detritus and dominated by opportunistic species. The lowest influence on delta N-15 signatures by aquaculture discharges recorded in the upper trophic levels could be explained by the shift in the composition of biotic communities, and associated feeding strategies. While alterations in resource availability do not affect directly food chain length, trophic linkages between food web compartments can be reduced as a result of shrimp farm impacts. Our study demonstrates that nutrient-enriched discharges from shrimp-farm aquaculture generate changes in the availability of food sources, which reduce biodiversity and alter structural and functional food web characteristics.

The experimental design explicitly addresses criticisms provoked by previous biodiversity experiments. In particular, the choice of functional groups, the statistical separation of sampling versus complementarity effects, and testing for the effects of particular functional groups differ from previous experiments. Based on a species pool of 60 plant species common to the Central European Arrhenatherion grasslands, mixtures of one to 16 (60) species and of one to four plant functional groups were established on 90 plots (20 in x 20 m) with nested experiments. In order to test specific hypotheses 390 additional small-area plots (3.5 m x 3.5 m) were set-up. Exact replicates of all species mixtures serve to assess the variability in ecosystem responses.

However, insect pests are still able to colonize these protected crops, which threaten their yields. Similarly, natural enemies of pests may be able to colonize greenhouses, providing a form of natural biological pest control. Protected strawberry crops are grown in several types of greenhouses that vary in their degree of openness. Crops often suffer from aphid outbreaks, which can be partly controlled by insect parasitoids immigrating from the surrounding environment. We investigated variations over space and time in both the aphid and parasitoid community diversity and species assemblages associated with protected strawberry crops. We sampled aphids and parasitoids in five regions of France in the spring and summer of two successive years. Despite the relative isolation of these protected crops, we identified a high aphid species richness in them, even at the greenhouse scale. Aphid community composition varied with spatial and temporal factors, but the species assemblages present were mostly determined by local factors. Parasitoid communities were mostly similar among the studied regions, but varied between seasons, with this temporal variation being related to changes in aphid species composition. The study of trophic interactions occurring between aphids and parasitoids allowed the most prevalent and efficient parasitoid species to be identified. The structures of food webs strongly varied in time and space, compromising any prediction of natural biological control. We also highlighted ecological factors that can disrupt aphid biological control, such as the occurrence of hyperparasitism or the possibility of apparent mutualism between aphid species. Finally, we showed that the degree of openness of greenhouses influenced both the aphid communities and the hyperparasitism rates in them. These results provide valuable information to improve aphid biological control in protected crops.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.3126,68,Oksana,,No,No ecosystem functions / no management effects on EF and no BEF,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A meta-analysis,"McDaniel, MD; Tiemann, LK; Grandy, AS",ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,agricultural biodiversity; crop rotation; meta-analysis; microbial biomass; monoculture; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; sustainable agroecosystems,"Our increasing dependence on a small number of agricultural crops, such as corn, is leading to reductions in agricultural biodiversity. Reductions in the number of crops in rotation or the replacement of rotations by monocultures are responsible for this loss of biodiversity. The belowground implications of simplifying agricultural plant communities remain unresolved; however, agroecosystem sustainability will be severely compromised if reductions in biodiversity reduce soil C and N concentrations, alter microbial communities, and degrade soil ecosystem functions as reported in natural communities. We conducted a meta-analysis of 122 studies to examine crop rotation effects on total soil C and N concentrations, and the faster cycling microbial biomass C and N pools that play key roles in soil nutrient cycling and physical processes such as aggregate formation. We specifically examined how rotation crop type and management practices influence C and N dynamics in different climates and soil types. We found that adding one or more crops in rotation to a monoculture increased total soil C by 3.6% and total N by 5.3%, but when rotations included a cover crop (i.e., crops that are not harvested but produced to enrich the soil and capture inorganic N), total C increased by 8.5% and total N 12.8%. Rotations substantially increased the soil microbial biomass C (20.7%) and N (26.1%) pools, and these overwhelming effects on microbial biomass were not moderated by crop type or management practices. Crop rotations, especially those that include cover crops, sustain soil quality and productivity by enhancing soil C, N, and microbial biomass, making them a cornerstone for sustainable agroecosystems.",2014,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/13-0616.1,69,Oksana,,No,Metaanalysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increasing agricultural landscape heterogeneity by increasing seminatural cover can help to mitigate biodiversity loss. However, the amount of seminatural cover is generally low and difficult to increase in many intensively managed agricultural landscapes. We hypothesized that increasing the heterogeneity of the crop mosaic itself (hereafter crop hetero-geneity) can also have positive effects on biodiversity. In 8 contrasting regions of Europe and North America, we selected 435 landscapes along independent gradients of crop diversity and mean field size. Within each landscape, we selected 3 sampling sites in 1, 2, or 3 crop types. We sampled 7 taxa (plants, bees, butterflies, hoverflies, carabids, spiders, and birds) and calculated a synthetic index of multitrophic diversity at the landscape level. Increasing crop heterogeneity was more beneficial for multitrophic diversity than increasing seminatural cover. For instance, the effect of decreasing mean field size from 5 to 2.8 ha was as strong as the effect of increasing seminatural cover from 0.5 to 11%. Decreasing mean field size benefited multitrophic diversity even in the absence of seminatural vegetation between fields. Increasing the number of crop types sampled had a positive effect on landscape-level multitrophic diversity. However, the effect of increasing crop diversity in the landscape surrounding fields sampled depended on the amount of seminatural cover. Our study provides large-scale, multitrophic, cross-regional evidence that increasing crop heterogeneity can be an effective way to increase biodiversity in agricultural landscapes without taking land out of agricultural production.",2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1906419116,70,Oksana,,No ,No ecosystem functions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Changing hydrology, specifically water movement, within wetlands significantly impacts the physico-chemical properties of the water body and hence can be employed to manipulate productivity and alter patterns of recruitment of commercial species and may also transfer non-native species from the supplying water bodies. The reconstructed wetlands of Veta la Palma in the Donana Natural Park are subjected to either a 1% or 5% d(-1) water exchange with water drawn from the adjacent Guadalquivir estuary. This site provides an excellent opportunity for examining the effect of water management on the food webs that support both the birdlife and aquaculture activities for which this habitat is managed. Stable isotopes were used to examine food webs in three replicate lagoons under each water management scheme. In lagoons receiving higher water exchange, phytoplankton productivity appeared to be more important than benthic production in supporting food webs. Increased water exchange also changed the shape of the food webs, facilitated the colonisation of at least one non-native species and increased the importance of non-native species in the diets of large commercially harvested fish (>60% of seabass diet). Lagoons with high water flows also had between three and four times greater shrimp biomass than those of low flow lagoons. Non-native fauna were opportunistic omnivores, eating marginally more non-natives in lagoons with greater water exchange. Overall non-native cordgrass Spartina densiflora contributed only slightly more to food webs compared with the native reed Phragmites australis, despite the lagoon edge occupancy ratio of 9:1, respectively. Non-natives also appear to enhance food provision for large predators and wetland birds, by increasing biomass, without competing for resources with native species, supporting the dual management objectives of aquaculture and waterbird conservation. Statement of relevance: Extensive aquaculture productivity appears to be positively correlated with water exchange rates. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, large-scale empirical evidence for in-field and landscape properties supporting natural enemy abundance and their regulation of pests, as an ecosystem service in agriculture, is scarce. Using data from 67 arable fields, we examined whether the duration of adoption of in-field conservation agricultural practices (CA) and the landscape context of those arable fields explains the levels of in-field weed seed predation. Our results indicate that landscape and CA, in interaction, do indeed explain a large proportion of the observed variation in weed seed predation in-field. CA practice maintains high in-field abundances of carabids, but only after a period of four years of adoption. Prior to this, carabid abundance was only high for fields in landscapes with high percentage cover of arable crops and/or permanent grassland. Our work shows that the effect of landscape composition is conditional on local in-field management and that both local and landscape scales can be used to enhance the abundance of carabid beetles and the amount of seed predation in arable fields.

123,Enrichment in biodiversity and maturation of the soil food web under conservation agriculture is associated with suppression of rice-parasitic nematodes,"Masson, AS; Vermeire, ML; Leng, V; Simonin, M; Tivet, F; Thi, HN; Brunel, C; Suong, M; Kuok, F; Moulin, L; Bellafiore, S",AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,Rice-based cropping systems; Soil microbiota; Nematode community; Pest management practices; Soil suppressiveness; Trophic groups,"Meloidogyne spp. and Hirschmanniella spp. are among the most damaging plant-parasitic nematodes (PPNs). They threaten rice production, the main staple food in Asia. Cropping systems that promote natural biocontrol and plant tolerance to diseases are put forward as sustainable solutions to protect rice from these pests. In particular, cropping systems managed under conservation agriculture (CA) are promising because they improve soil health and functioning. We investigated the effects of two cropping system components in a Cambodian field, (i) CA practices, i.e., no-tillage with a cover crop Stylosanthes guianensis (cv. Nina), versus conventional plow-based tillage with no cover crop, and (ii) using IR504, IR64, Azucena and Zhonghua 11 rice varieties, on PPNs in roots and on communities (bacteria, fungi and nematodes) in the rhizosphere. We used a sequencing approach via amplicon barcoding to target microbial marker genes (16 S and ITS rRNA gene) and a microscopic approach to identify and quantify nematodes in the rhizosphere compartment. The variety had less effect than agricultural practices on the infection by PPNs and on the assembly of the three rhizosphere communities. Under CA, the abundance of PPNs extracted from the roots was reduced by 88%. Soil quality was substantially improved (+83% of total Kjeldahl nitrogen, +34% of available phosphorus, +10% of exchangeable potassium, +110% of soil organic carbon, +30% for the cation exchange capacity), thus providing more basal resources for microbial decomposers, especially fungi (+164% putative saprotrophs). Characterization of the three rhizosphere communities revealed a shift in the structure associated with soil enrichment. Both microbial richness (+3% for bacteria and +38% for fungi) and diversity (Shannon index, +11% for fungi and +5% for nematodes) increased. The relative abundance of taxa was modified by CA with notably more mycorrhizal fungi (+329% Glomeromycota spp.) and fewer Pratylenchidae nematodes (-92% Hirschmanniella spp.) in the rhizosphere. The reassembly of the communities using CA was associated with regulation of PPN populations. The reduction in Meloidogyne spp. abundance in roots (-64%) was correlated with the maturity of the food web (maturity index, +10% under CA) and with the increase in the relative abundance of omnivorous nematodes in the rhizosphere (+68% under CA). Seven years of CA in this field enabled the whole soil food web to mature thus creating a favorable niche for potentially predatory nematodes and microbes antagonistic against PPNs. This study confirms that CA is an alternative to nematicides to limit infection by PPNs in rice cropping systems.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2022.107913,74,Oksana,,Yes,NA,field observation,Land use intensity: conservation agriculture (no-tillage with a cover crop) -> conventional plow-based tillage with no cover crop ,Land use intensity,Management intensity,Cropland management (combined),"tillage, cover crop presence",NA,herbivory,herbivory,herbivory rate,herbivory,infection rates by plant-parasitic nematodes,disservice,rate,rate,2,BG,soil,negative,rice variety,No,NA,indirect,via land use,"2,3",consumers,consumers,soil consumers,"invertebrates, microorganisms","bacteria, fungi, nematodes","bacteria, fungi, nematodes",species,richness,richness,NA,NA,NA,negative,"consumer taxa (bacteria, fungi, nematodes)",No,NA,NA,NA,No,NA,NA,Yes,rice variety,NA,NA,NA,croplands,tropical lowland rice fields,Asia,Cambodia,Cambodia,1232?55??

124,Effects of weed biodiversity on the ecosystem service of weed seed predation along a farming intensity gradient,"Schumacher, M; Dieterich, M; Gerhards, R",GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,Agricultural intensity; Carabid beetle community; Ecosystem service; Food web; Seed predation,"Weed biodiversity plays a key role in supporting food webs and ecosystem services in agroecosystems. One important service, that reduces weed abundance, is the predation of weed seeds by invertebrates and vertebrates. In this context weed biodiversity may be supportive in maintaining seed predator prevalence. This however, can be highly influenced by farming systems. In the present study we examined the connections between weed diversity, carabid beetle diversity and weed seed predation (WSP) rate. Additionally, the influence of a farming intensity gradient on WSP rate and predator groups was evaluated. An on-farm experiment on the Eastern Swabian Alps was set up from 2015 to 2017, where we determined the weed diversity, carabid beetle diversity using pitfall traps and WSP rates and predator groups by utilizing seed cards and exclosure cages. There was a linear correlation between weed diversity and carabid beetle diversity as well as a pattern showing that intermediate diversity of carabid beetles (3-8 species) exhibited the highest WSP rates by invertebrates. However, a direct connection between weed diversity and WSP was not detected. Farming intensity had no consistent influence on WSP, rather year and specific agronomic measures like cover cropping most presumably affected WSP. Carabid beetle communities were similar in 2016 and 2017 with omnivorous species dominating in the conventional fields and granivorous species in extensively managed fields. The most efficient seed predators were vertebrates. The promotion of beneficial predators and ecosystem services like WSP is possible by designing appropriate management strategies. Key components of these strategies should be the conservation of plant diversity and the utilization of weed control strategies such as cover cropping that provide suitable habitats for beneficial predators.

In these conditions, increasing SUM concentration has several agronomic and environmental benefits, ranging from increase in water holding capacity to soil protection and carbon sequestration. We develop a model to express the short-term trend of SUM increase in grasslands as the balance between input and mineralization. This model is calibrated using five years of soil analyses from eight locations. In each location there were either two or three plots with the different grassland systems considered: sown biodiverse permanent pastures rich in legumes (SBPPRLs), fertilized natural grasslands (FNGs), and (un-improved) natural grasslands (NGs). SBPPRL are a new system consisting in the use of plant biodiversity to increase pasture productivity and resilience. So far, they exist mostly in Portugal. We use statistical calibration to adjust an asymptotic curve to the data and obtain the model parameters. Under the assumption of equal mineralization rates across grassland systems, we find that the expected steady-state long term SUM concentration in undisturbed SBPPRL is higher than in NC and FNG. Fertilization does not significantly increase SUM input, and so the trend in SUM is equal for NC and FNG. In 10 years, there is an average increase of 0.21 percentage points per year in SBPPRL In turn, SUM increases in FNG and NC are 0.08 percentage points per year. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The expansion of eucalyptus plantations has caused several issues affecting biodiversity, such as loss of species within communities as well as alterations to ecosystem function. Previous studies of biodiversity in eucalyptus plantations have focused on single biological groups or trophic levels. How the whole biological community and trophic interactions within these plantations are affected is still poorly known. We conducted a comprehensive collection of primary producers and consumers from 42 eucalyptus plantations planted between one and 25 years ago. Primary producers, including plant materials and soil organic matter, showed significant differences in both delta C-13 and delta N-15 values. Values of delta C-13 and delta N-15 of consumers from eucalyptus plantations varied from -30.2 parts per thousand to -18.6 parts per thousand and from -1.9 parts per thousand to 8.4 parts per thousand, respectively. Both delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of consumers differed among five trophic groups that we identified in eucalyptus plantations. Trophic levels in eucalyptus plantations were estimated from 1.4 to 4.4. Stable isotope evidence showed that leaves of both exotic eucalyptus, understory and adjacent sugarcane, contributed to the consumer food webs. Our results suggested food webs associated with eucalyptus plantations had complete trophic structure and depended on a suite of food sources. Nutrient inputs were typically also derived from adjacent areas indicating that maintaining diversity at the landscape level is needed to augment biodiversity and functioning of foodwebs in eucalyptus plantations.

Predation of insect pests is an indicator of healthy ecosystem functioning, which provides important ecosystem services, especially for agricultural systems. In this study, we compare predation attempts from arthropods, mammals, and birds on artificial caterpillars in the understory, between three tropical agricultural land-use types: oil palm plantations, rubber tree plantations, and fruit orchards. We collected a range of local and landscape-scale data including undergrowth vegetation structure; elevation; proximity to forest; and canopy cover in order to understand how environmental variables can affect predation. In all three land-use types, our results showed that arthropods and mammals were important predators of artificial caterpillars and there was little predation by birds. We did not find any effect of the environmental variables on predation. There was an interactive effect between land-use type and predator type. Predation by mammals was considerably higher in fruit orchards and rubber tree than in oil palm plantations, likely due to their ability to support higher abundances of insectivorous mammals. In order to maintain or enhance natural pest control in these common tropical agricultural land-use types, management practices that benefit insectivorous animals should be introduced, such as the reduction of pesticides, improvement of understory vegetation, and local and landscape heterogeneity.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.5856,78,Oksana,,No,No biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

130,Prey removal in cotton crops next to woodland reveals periodic diurnal and nocturnal invertebrate predation gradients from the crop edge by birds and bats,"Kolkert, HL; Smith, R; Rader, R; Reid, N",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,,"Factors influencing the efficacy of insectivorous vertebrates in providing natural pest control services inside crops at increasing distances from the crop edge are poorly understood. We investigated the identity of vertebrate predators (birds and bats) and removal of sentinel prey (mealworms and beetles) from experimental feeding trays in cotton crops using prey removal trials, camera traps and observations. More prey was removed during the day than at night, but prey removal was variable at the crop edge and dependent on the month (reflecting crop growth and cover) and time of day. Overall, the predation of mealworms and beetles was 1-times and 13-times greater during the day than night, respectively, with predation on mealworms 3-5 times greater during the day than night at the crop edge compared to 95 m inside the crop. Camera traps identified many insectivorous birds and bats over crops near the feeding trays, but there was no evidence of bats or small passerines removing experimental prey. A predation gradient from the crop edge was evident, but only in some months. This corresponded to the foraging preferences of open-space generalist predators (magpies) in low crop cover versus the shrubby habitat preferred by small passerines, likely facilitating foraging away from the crop edge later in the season. Our results are in line with Optimal Foraging Theory and suggest that predators trade-off foraging behaviour with predation risk at different distances from the crop edge and levels of crop cover. Understanding the optimal farm configuration to support insectivorous bird and bat populations can assist farmers to make informed decisions regarding in-crop natural pest control and maximise the predation services provided by farm biodiversity.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-84633-8,80,Oksana,,No,No biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assessed how seasonal litterfall affects leaf litter breakdown, density and biomass of aquatic invertebrates, and the microbial biomass and sporulation of aquatic hyphomycetes in a South American grassland 'vereda' landscape. Although litter production in the riparian area was low, leaf litter breakdown was high compared with other South American systems, with maximum values coinciding with the rainy season. Fungal biomass in decomposing leaves was high, but spore densities in water and sporulation rates were very low. Invertebrates were not abundant in litter bags, suggesting they play a minor role in leaf litter decomposition. Chironomids accounted for similar to 70 percent of all invertebrates; only 10 percent of non-Chironomidae invertebrates were shredders. Therefore, fungi appear to be the drivers of leaf litter decomposition. Our results show that despite low productivity and relatively fast litter decomposition, organic matter accumulated in the stream and riparian area. This pattern was attributed to the wet/dry cycles in which leaves falling in the flat riparian zone remain undecomposed (during the dry period) and are massively transported to the riverbed (rainy season).",2016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/btp.12308,81,Oksana,,No,"Not agricultural ecosystem, streams",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of replacement of native forest by pasture and natural regeneration of vegetation on soil and on soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics in the dry and rainy season in an Atlantic Forest fragment in Passa Vinte, Minas Gerais (MG), Brazil. Soil samples were collected in the rainy and dry season, at a depth of 0.00-0.05 m. The variables determined were total organic carbon (TOC) and particle-size fractions of SOM [particulate organic carbon (POC) and mineral-associated organic carbon (MOC)]; microbial activity by basal respiration (BR) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC); species richness (SR) and spore abundance (SA) of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF); and total and easily extractable glomalin-related soil protein (T-GRSP and EE-GRSP, respectively). The conversion of native forest into pasture reduced TOC, POC, MOC, AMF-SA, T-GRSP, and EE-GRSP. However, it did not reduce MBC and BR. The fallow period in the area under natural regeneration was not long enough to restore soil TOC, POC, MOC, BR, MBC, T-GRSP, and EE-GRSP to levels approaching those observed in the forest area. Nevertheless, natural regeneration of vegetation stimulated the production of seedlings (spores) of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, which are important for the establishment of plant species and advance of ecological succession.

However, this strategy can have negative biodiversity impacts, potentially causing the loss and fragmentation of open habitats of conservation value, as well as edge effects that can extend well beyond forest boundaries. Mitigating impacts of afforestation programs thus requires a detailed understanding of the mechanisms whereby they affect biodiversity, particularly where new plantations are established close to areas important for open habitat species. Here, we examined how afforestation with oak, pine or eucalyptus trees, commonly planted in Mediterranean Europe, may have distinct effects on nest predation risk of grassland birds in southern Portugal. We used artificial nests with quail eggs and camera traps to: (i) identify nest predators and estimate predation risk of ground-nesting birds in grasslands adjacent to oak, pine and eucalyptus plantations across a distance gradient (0 m to 300 m) from the plantation edge; and (ii) examine how predation risk was influenced by avian predator abundance, sward height and vegetation clearing for photo monitoring (nest-site manipulation), and their interactions with plantation type. Carrion crow was by far the main egg predator identified, followed by Montagu's harrier, raven and magpie. Overall, nest predation risk and predator abundance were higher around eucalyptus plantations, compared to either pine or oak plantations. Predation decreased with increasing sward height, but this effect was less noticeable when vegetation around nests was cleared. In pine and oak plantations, predation risk was slightly higher close to edges, and decreased with distance from the edge. Conversely, in eucalyptus plantations predation was lower close to edges, and increased with distance to edges. Distance effects around eucalyptus plantation were, however, absent in manipulated nests. Overall, results show that afforestation with different tree species has distinct impacts on predation risk of artificial nests in Mediterranean farmland. This is probably a consequence of an increasing structural complexity of the plantations, from oak to eucalyptus, driven by differences in tree growth rates and undergrowth cover. These findings suggest that farmland afforestation should favour agro-forest plantations with slow growing species (oak and pine) to mitigate negative effects on breeding grassland birds in adjacent open habitats.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120116,84,Oksana,,No,No biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Organic farming, complex landscapes with high proportions of seminatural habitats and local vineyard management practices such as implementation of flower-rich cover-crop mixtures may be a promising approach to enhance arthropod biodiversity and, thus, natural pest control in viticulture. We examined effects of organic farming, different types of vineyard inter-row vegetation, and landscape composition on natural pest control of a major grapevine pest, the grape berry moth Lobesia botrana, and identified its dominant natural enemies. Surprisingly, natural pest control was reduced by sown cover-crops and organic farming. Interestingly, bush crickets were one of the most dominant natural enemies in the Austrian study region. Negative effects of organic farming in our study are most likely related to high fungicide inputs. Thus, a promising approach to reduce fungicide input and, therefore, promote a more sustainable viticulture may be the implementation of fungus-resistant grape varieties. Habitat simplification and intensive use of pesticides are main drivers of global arthropod declines and are, thus, decreasing natural pest control. Organic farming, complex landscapes, and local vineyard management practices such as implementation of flower-rich cover-crop mixtures may be a promising approach to enhance predator abundance and, therefore, natural pest control. We examined the effect of organic versus integrated management, cover-crop diversity in the vineyard inter-rows, and landscape composition on the natural pest control of Lobesia botrana eggs and pupae. Predation of L. botrana pupae was reduced by organic farming and species-poor cover-crops by about 10%. Predation rates of L. botrana eggs did not differ significantly in any of the studied management options. Dominant predators were earwigs (Forficulidae), bush crickets (Tettigoniidae), and ants (Formicidae). Negative effects of organic viticulture are most likely related to the negative nontarget effects on arthropods related to the frequent sulfur and copper applications in combination with the avoidance of strongly damaging insecticides by integrated winegrowers. While a 10% difference in predation rates on a single pest stage is unlikely to have strong practical implications, our results show that the assumed effectiveness of environmentally friendly agriculture needs to be evaluated for specific crops and regions.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects12030220,86,Oksana,,No,No biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we reported significant and positive relationships between soil biodiversity of multiple organism groups and multiple ecosystem functions in 228 agricultural fields, relating to crop yield, nutrient provisioning, element cycling, and pathogen control.

146,Multitrophic diversity effects depend on consumer specialization and species-specific growth and grazing rates,"Filip, J; Bauer, B; Hillebrand, H; Beniermann, A; Gaedke, U; Moorthi, SD",OIKOS,,"Ecosystem functioning is affected by horizontal (within trophic groups) and vertical (across trophic levels) biodiversity. Theory predicts that the effects of vertical biodiversity depend on consumer specialization. In a microcosm experiment, we investigated ciliate consumer diversity and specialization effects on algal prey biovolume, evenness and composition, and on ciliate biovolume production. The experimental data was complemented by a process-based model further analyzing the ecological mechanisms behind the observed diversity effects. Overall, increasing consumer diversity had no significant effect on prey biovolume or evenness. However, consumer specialization affected the prey community. Specialist consumers showed a stronger negative impact on prey biovolume and evenness than generalists. The model confirmed that this pattern was mainly driven by a single specialist with a high per capita grazing rate, consuming the two most productive prey species. When these were suppressed, the prey assemblage became dominated by a less productive species, consequently decreasing prey biovolume and evenness. Consumer diversity increased consumer biovolume, which was stronger for generalists than for specialists and highest in mixed combinations, indicating that consumer functional diversity, i.e. more diverse feeding strategies, increased resource use efficiency. Overall, our results indicate that consumer diversity effects on prey and consumers strongly depend on species-specific growth and grazing rates, which may be at least equally important as consumer specialization in driving consumer diversity effects across trophic levels.",###,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.01219,90,Jana,,No,No agricultural context (ciliate microcosm experiment),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Being a non-washable food, no pesticide residues are allowed, which increases the importance of natural means of plant protection. Predation, a component of natural pest control, is an important contributor to this, but its level and sustainability are not known in most of the areas of tea production. We quantified predation intensity using the artificial sentinel prey method in a tea-growing landscape containing remnants of the original forest vegetation in Fujian Province, China. The most common predators were chewing arthropods (49.8% of predation events) and birds (48.1%). Overall, predation rates at the edges of forest fragments (18.9% d(-1)) were lower than either in fragment interiors (25.4%d(-1)) or in the surrounding tea plantations (19.2-24.1%d(-1)). Arthropod predation was higher inside, and at the edge of, forest fragments than within plantations, and generally decreased with increasing distance from a fragment edge, indicating limited spillover of arthropod predators from the native habitat remnants to the cultivated matrix at the local scale. Bird predation, though, showed a different trend: it was lower on the inside of forest fragments than in the tea planation, and bird attack rates increased at increasing distances (up to 40 m) from the forest fragment edge. We also found a reciprocal relationship between attack rates by birds and arthropods, suggesting intra-guild predation. Measures protecting arthropod natural enemies could increase the combined pest suppression effect, contributing to pesticide-free tea production in China.",###,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects11040212,91,Jana,,No,No biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
148,Post-dispersal seed predation of three grassland species in a plant diversity experiment,"Pufal, G; Klein, AM",JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY,arthropods; cafeteria-style experiments; ecosystem functions; granivorous taxa; slugs,"Aims Post-dispersal seed predation is an important ecosystem process because it can influence the seed's fate after the initial dispersal from the mother plant and subsequently transform communities. Even at small scales, post-dispersal seed predation can vary greatly depending on seed identity, granivorous taxa or microhabitat structure. However, little is known about the role of plant species richness and functional group richness in post-dispersal seed predation. The overall aim of this study was to test whether increasing plant species richness or plant functional group richness affects the rate and variability of post-dispersal seed predation. We additionally investigated the influence of vegetation structure and seed species identity on the rate and variability of post-dispersal seed predation and whether the influence of different granivorous taxa changed with increasing plant species richness. Methods We conducted seed removal experiments along a long-term experimental plant diversity gradient, comprising plots with monocultures to 60 species mixtures of common grassland species in Jena, Germany, in August 2011. We studied seeds of Onobrychis viciifolia, Pastinaca sativa and Trifolium pratense in exclusion experiments (seed cafeterias), an experimental setup that allowed access either for arthropods or slugs or for all granivorous taxa. Traditionally, seeds removed from seed cafeterias were classified as consumed but we used traceable fluorescent-coloured seeds to obtain more accurate predation rates by subtracting recovered seeds from overall removed seeds. The effect of multiple vegetation variables on mean and variability of seed predation rates was analysed using generalized mixed-effect models and linear regressions, respectively. Important Findings Rates of recovered seeds were low but contributed to significant differences between seed predation rates and removal rates of seeds in some treatments. Seed predation rates were not directly correlated with increasing plant species richness or plant functional group richness but were influenced byseed species identity and granivorous taxa. Vegetation variables such as vegetation height and cover were significantly associated with seed predation rates. Depending on the seed species and/or the granivorous taxa, different vegetation variables correlated with seed predation rates. Our results indicate that effects of plant functional group richness and multiple vegetation variables on the magnitude of post-dispersal seed predation varied with seed identity and seed predator taxa. A direct effect of plant species and plant functional group richness could be shown on the variability of post-dispersal seed predation for some seed species and their respective predators. Thus, the changes in magnitude of post-dispersal seed predation with increasing plant species richness could potentially impact the fitness of some plant species and thereby influence plant community structure.",###,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jpe/rtt011,92,Jana,,Yes,NA,manipulative field experiment,"Grassland plots (no additional management differences, differences in plant richness are included under""biodiversity manipulation"")",Biodiversity effects,Plant diversity,Plant community diversity,grassland plant diversity,BEF,herbivory,herbivory,seed predation,seed predation,"removel rate of seeds by ants, slugs, all granivores (also recovered seed measured), seed removal (cafeteria) experiment",disservice,rate,rate,2,AG,soil surface,NA,NA,Yes,plant diversity,direct,direct,1,plants,plants,plants,plants,plants,plants,species,richness,richness,neutral,mixed model,text,NA,NA,No,NA,NA,NA,No,NA,NA,Yes,"vegetation height, ant hills, bare soil/plant cover, undergrowth cover",biotic properties of study system,"plant taxa, consumer taxa","seed species, seed predator groups",grasslands,grassland,Europe,Germany,Germany,50 55?

Crop seed predation by ants can cause substantial yield loss and result in high pesticide use. 2 We conducted field experiments and questionnaire-based surveys aiming to assess the effect of sown-seed predation on four crop species (Cucumis sativus, Daucus carota, Capsicum frutescens and Solanum melongena) in 15 vegetable gardens and the resulting impact on the net income of Indonesian farmers. Furthermore, we tested a commonly applied insecticide and herbicide for seed, seedling and plant protection aiming to understand their effect on ant seed predation. 3 We found that the mean percentage of seeds removed per garden was 42.0%, 49.4%, 48.0% and 50.6% for C. sativus, D. carota, C. frutescens and S. melongena, respectively, halving the farmers' income after considering initial and operational costs. Insecticide and herbicide treatments did not affect seed predation success or overall ant abundance, although they had positive and negative effects on ant species-specific abundance. 4 High overall ant abundance caused high seed predation rate in all gardens as a result of a functional redundancy of ant species, which compensated for pesticide-related species loss. 5 Environmentally-friendly and more sustainable practices such as overseeding or seedling production in nurseries could substitute for these inefficient approaches of chemical pest control, although this requires further research.",###,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/afe.12011,93,Jana,,Yes,NA,manipulative field experiment,Pesticide application treatment in vegetable gardens,Land use intensity,Pesticides,Pesticides,,NA,herbivory,herbivory,seed predation,crop seed predation,"removel rate of seeds by ants, seed removal experiments",disservice,rate,rate,2,AG,soil surface,neutral,crop species,Yes,"heterotrophs removal/presence (pesticide treatments: control, insecticide, herbicide, combined) but did not find effect",direct,direct,2,herbivores,1st_cons,seed predators,invertebrates,arthropods,ants,species,richness,richness,NA,NA,NA,neutral,No,No,NA,NA,NA,No,NA,NA,No,No,NA,NA,NA,croplands,vegetable fields,Asia,Indonesia,Indonesia,,,No BEF

Birds are important seed predators and use high landscape structures to perch and hide. High trees in agricultural landscapes may therefore drive seed predation. We examined if the presence, the distance and the percentages of high trees (tree height >5 m) and the percentages of natural habitat surrounding sunflower fields, increased seed predation by birds in Israel. At the field scale, we assessed seed predation across a sample grid of an entire field. At the landscape scale, we assessed seed predation at the field margins and interiors of 20 sunflower fields. Seed predation was estimated as the percentage of removed seeds from sunflower heads. Distances of sample points to the closest high tree and percentage of natural habitat and of high trees in a 1 km radius surrounding the fields were measured. We found that seed predation increased with decreasing distance to the closest high tree at the field and landscape scale. At the landscape scale, the percentage of high trees and natural habitat did not increase seed predation. Seed predation in the fields increased by 37%, with a maximum seed predation of 92%, when a high tree was available within 0-50 m to the sunflower fields. If the closest high tree was further away, seed predation was less than 5%. Sunflower seed predation by birds can be reduced, when avoiding sowing sunflowers within a radius of 50 m to high trees. Farmers should plan to grow crops, not sensitive to bird seed predation, closer to trees to eventually benefit from ecosystem services provided by birds, such as predation of pest insects, while avoiding these locations for growing crops sensitive to bird seed predation. Such management recommendations are directing toward sustainable agricultural landscapes.",###,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2014.00035,94,Jana,,No,No biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In response, farmers are incentivised to sow flower strips along field margins to counteract resource bottlenecks. Yet, it is poorly understood how effective this diversification practice is when combined with the supplementation of honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) hives, which is commonly used to boost insect pollination in flowering crops. Honeybees share floral resources with wild pollinators and natural enemies of pests, which could lead to competition for food resources. We sampled pollinators, natural enemies and their pests as well as estimated the benefit of insect pollination in 17 organic faba bean (Vicia faba minor L.) fields in southern Sweden either with or without sown annual flower strips and with or without added honeybee hives. In fields with flower strips, bumblebee (Bombus spp.) densities were redistributed from field edges to interiors but without affecting their overall densities. Flower strips enhanced silver Y moth (Autographa gamma L.) densities and carabid beetle Shannon diversity along the field edge, and overall spider activity density. The supplementation of honeybee hives enhanced honeybee densities, overall ladybird beetle densities, black bean aphid (Aphis fabae Scop.) densities along field edges, but deterred silver Y moths and pushed bumblebees towards the field interior. Bean mass per plant was higher in insect pollinated plants compared with bagged, self-pollinated plants. This insect pollination benefit was independent of honeybee hive supplementation and the flower strip treatment suggesting that faba bean fields were not deficient in pollinator visits. We conclude that flower strips did not provide sufficient floral resources to increase overall wild pollinator densities in faba bean fields. Yet, annual flower strips attracted and facilitated ground-dwelling predators, especially spiders, to faba bean fields, likely by providing beneficial shelter habitats. It is worth noting that 2018, in which we collected our data, was characterised by late frosts in spring followed by an unusually hot and dry summer. While these unforeseen weather conditions together with a relatively small sample size might limit the generalisation of our results, we argue that conducting experiments under such conditions provide insights into the effectiveness of agri-environmental schemes under climate change, especially considering that such weather conditions are becoming increasingly more frequent.",###,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2021.107754,95,Jana,,Yes,NA,manipulative field experiment,With/without flower strip and bee hives,Land use intensity,Cover crop effects,Cover crop absence,Flowering cover crop absence,NA,pollination,pollination,pollinator abundance,pollination,pollination,service,stock,stock,2,AG,"herb, soil surface",negative,"taxa group, distance from flower strip",Yes,flower strip vs honey bee augmentation,trophic cascades,trophic cascades,2,pollinators,1st_cons,insect pollinators,invertebrates,arthropods,insects (specific species and groups),species,richness,richness,NA,NA,NA,neutral,NA,No,NA,NA,NA,No,NA,NA,No,No,NA,NA,NA,croplands,faba bean field,Europe,Sweden,Sweden,,,No BEF.

Whereas herbivores can cause substantial crop losses, natural enemies can offer pest regulation services that otherwise would be difficult to obtain. Two major factors affecting arthropod communities within plantations are farming practices and surrounding landscape. Previous studies have shown that natural enemies are less abundant in plantations within simplified landscapes and intense management practices, while herbivores do not always respond to these factors. Given the different roles of arthropods in plantations, we assessed the cascading effects that the surrounding landscape and different management practices can have on different arthropod guilds in papaya plantations, ultimately affecting plant damage and fruit production. A piecewise structural equation model was used to assess the direct and indirect effects of management practices and landscape upon herbivores and their natural enemies, and their cascading effects on papaya leaf damage and fruit production. We studied 11 papaya plantations in the surroundings of a tropical dry forest (TDF) in Jalisco, Mexico. The model indicated that there is a decrease of natural enemies with intensive conventional management, which had no effect on pest abundance. Furthermore, surrounding landscape had an effect on pest abundance and not on predators, but this effect was different between seasons. Even when pest abundance explained crop damage, this was not reflected on fruit production. Crop yield was explained by management practices, available phosphorus in soil and by the abundance of natural enemies.",###,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2020.106836,96,Jana,,No,No biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
154,Netting and pan traps fail to identify the pollinator guild of an agricultural crop,"Boyer, KJ; Fragoso, FP; Mabin, MED; Brunet, J",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,,"Pollinator decline is expected to cause significant reductions in food production and plant reproduction. Quantifying the impact of pollinator decline on food production requires survey methods that can identify insect and bee species responsible for pollination of specific crops. To address this issue, we compared the effectiveness of two survey methods, netting and pan traps, at capturing the pollinators of alfalfa, Medicago sativa. Alfalfa is a major component of forage for cows and an important ingredient in chicken feed. We also examined bee species richness and diversity with these two survey methods, and compared these measures among three different colors of pan traps. Netting was more effective at capturing known pollinators of alfalfa, especially those belonging to the Bombus and Apis genera. Pan traps captured a higher bee diversity relative to netting and, like previous studies, each survey method and each trap color was more efficient at capturing certain bee genera. However, without a priori knowledge of pollinators, neither survey method could identify which of the bee species captured could pollinate alfalfa. We therefore recommend direct observations when the goal of a study is to identify pollinators or link pollinator decline to food production.",###,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-70518-9,97,Jana,,No,No ecosystem functions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The influence of the amount and configuration of reconstructed prairie vegetation on the delivery of ecosystem services was investigated in several small catchments at Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge in Iowa. Treatments include catchments entirely in row crops under a no-till, corn-soybean (Zea mays L.-Glycine max [L.] Merrill) rotation, catchments with 10% of the land in prairie located at the base, and catchments with 10 or 20% of the land in multiple contour strips of prairie. During 2009 and 2011 growing seasons, we measured abundance and diversity of aphidophagous insect predators in response to treatment and habitat type (i.e., soybean, prairie). In 2011, we further studied the biological control of soybean aphids by artificially infesting uncaged and caged plants to prevent exposure from predators. While aphidophagous predators were more abundant in prairie, populations of key aphid predators did not significantly differ among treatments. Biological control of the soybean aphid did not differ among treatments or with distance from prairie. Our results suggest that prairie strips, in addition to providing soil and water quality benefits, may increase the populations of beneficial insects, but may not directly impact biocontrol. We propose several hypotheses to explain why we did not observe more soybean aphid predation with the increased abundance of aphidophagous predators in catchments containing prairie.",###,http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/EN13129,98,Jana,,No,No biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, bee response to the disturbance of biomass harvesting may depend on their nesting location, thus their vulnerability to nest destruction, and the response of the forb community on which they forage. Moreover, because bees have long foraging ranges, effects of local harvesting may depend on the amount of natural habitat in the surrounding landscape. We performed a large-scale one- and two-year experiment in Michigan and Wisconsin, USA, respectively, to examine how grassland harvesting, landscape context, and study year affect the forb community, above- and belowground-nesting bee species richness, community composition, trap nest emergence, and visitation rate. In Wisconsin, harvesting increased forb richness, cover, and evenness compared to unharvested control sites. Harvesting negatively affected aboveground-nesting bee richness and emergence from trap nests, possibly because of nest destruction during the previous harvest. By contrast, harvesting positively affected belowground-nesting bee richness, possibly because of the greater food resource availability and reduced thatch allowing greater access to nesting sites in the soil. Harvesting also affected bee community composition, reflecting the increase in belowground-nesting species at harvested sites. Despite harvesting effects on forb and bee communities, there was no effect on flower visitation rate, indicating little effect on pollination function. We did not find a harvest by landscape context interaction, which, in combination with the negative harvesting effect on trap nest emergence, suggests that harvesting can affect local population growth rather than simply affecting forager aggregation in different resource environments. For bees, there was no harvest by study year interaction, indicating a consistent response over a short timescale. Similarly, in Michigan, belowground-nesting species also responded positively to harvesting, which was more pronounced in sandier soils that are preferred for nesting.

158,Guild structure of spiders in major crops,"Uetz, GW; Halaj, J; Cady, AB",JOURNAL OF ARACHNOLOGY,,"The ecological guild concept has been of great interest to arachnologists, and the different manner in which spiders forage for a common resource-prey arthropods-has led to numerous attempts to classify them into guilds. However, questions have been raised about the validity of guilds and the taxon-centered basis of their definition. Here, we propose an alternative approach to guild classification, using quantitative analysis of ecological characteristics of spider families. While generalizations may not apply to all species within a taxon, results from this approach suggest eight major spider guilds similar to earlier guild assignments by some authors and provide a reasonable framework for future studies. We used this classification in a comparison of spider guild composition across several major crops (from published studies). While total species richness varied widely among crops, the proportion of the total species within each guild was remarkably even across crops. The relative abundance of guilds (based on numbers of individuals) varied greatly, which may reflect availability of resources within a crop type. Patterns of similarity in guild composition suggest the possibility of plant habitat structure as an influence on the spider community. Further detailed analyses of spider guilds in various crops have been constrained by both a lack of comparable quantitative data and the paucity of behavioral and natural history information available for many taxa. As recent studies have shown that assemblages of spiders can impact pest populations and reduce crop damage, a better understanding of spider guild composition and variation in spider community structure among crops is essential in future studies of the arthropod fauna in agroecosystems.",###,https://www.jstor.org/stable/3705998,100,Jana,,No,No ecosystem functions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used the predatory attacks on lepidopteran dummies as a proxy to assess predation rates in the agricultural matrix and different EIs types according to their location and vegetation structure. We aimed at comparing the effect of different types of EI on the predation intensity in two intensively irrigated agricultural areas located in the Sorraia and Tagus river valleys in central Portugal. We hypothesized that: (1) the predation rate would be higher near EIs compared with the agricultural matrix, (2) the positive effect of EIs on predation rate would differ with their typologies, and (3) the EIs' proximity and proportion in the surrounding landscape would have a positive effect on the predation rate in agricultural fields. The EI typologies influenced differently the predator groups and the overall predation rate. Major differences were observed for bird predation, being higher in woody EIs. A positive correlation between predation rate and EIs area of the surrounding landscape, as well as a negative correlation with the distance to the nearest riparian and woody EIs, was observed for birds. The observed dissimilarities in the predators' response may be related to habitat differences and its functional connectivity. The overall monthly low predation rates are possibly related to the intensive agricultural system and the small area occupied by EIs.",###,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14073874,101,Jana,,No,not really measured (or analysed or reported) bird species richness or any other richness,sentinel prey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This hypothesis was tested on a subthermophilous grassland and a mesotrophic meadow at a scale of 0.09 m(2) based on a five-year data set. Further, variation in the total number of species, variation in the number of species belonging to a guild and non-randomness in species composition of guilds were studied. A number of criteria for guild definition were used, such as life form, Grime's C-S-R strategy, phenology, plant height, pollination and dispersal syndromes, leaf shape and anatomy and taxonomy at the family level. The observed variation in the number of guild species corresponded to the null model in which species assemblages with fixed species richness per square were randomly generated from the species pool. The observed variation in the number of guild species was often higher than the variation calculated for randomly distributed species whereas the variation in the proportion of guild species was in some cases lower than the variation calculated for randomly distributed species with fixed frequencies. Possible reasons for the discrepancy in the results based on different models are discussed.

These trophic groups were influenced by season, crop species and GMHT management. Many groups increased twofold to fivefold in abundance between early and late summer, and differed up to 10-fold between crop species. GMHT management superimposed relatively small (less than twofold), but consistent, shifts in plant and insect abundance, the extent and direction of these effects being dependent on the relative efficacies of comparable conventional herbicide regimes. In general, the biomass of weeds was reduced under GMHT management in beet and spring oilseed rape and increased in maize compared with conventional treatments. This change in resource availability had knock-on effects on higher trophic levels except in spring oilseed rape where herbivore resource was greatest. Herbivores, pollinators and natural enemies changed in abundance in the same directions as their resources, and detritivores increased in abundance under GMHT management across all crops. The result of the later herbicide application in GMHT treatments was a shift in resource from the herbivore food web to the detritivore food web. The Farm Scale Evaluations have demonstrated over 3 years and throughout the UK that herbivores, detritivores and many of their predators and parasitoids in arable systems are sensitive to the changes in weed communities that result from the introduction of new herbicide regimes.",###,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2003.1406,104,Jana,,No,No ecosystem functions (except maybe weed biomass but that's rather a driver than a response),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
163,Complexity of multitrophic interactions in a grassland ecosystem depends on plant species diversity,"Rzanny, M; Voigt, W",JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,arthropods; connectance; experimental grasslands; food webs; functional groups; interaction webs; invertebrates; partial Mantel test,"1. We studied the theoretical prediction that a loss of plant species richness has a strong impact on community interactions among all trophic levels and tested whether decreased plant species diversity results in a less complex structure and reduced interactions in ecological networks. 2. Using plant species-specific biomass and arthropod abundance data from experimental grassland plots (Jena Experiment), we constructed multitrophic functional group interaction webs to compare communities based on 4 and 16 plant species. 427 insect and spider species were classified into 13 functional groups. These functional groups represent the nodes of ecological networks. Direct and indirect interactions among them were assessed using partial Mantel tests. Interaction web complexity was quantified using three measures of network structure: connectance, interaction diversity and interaction strength. 3. Compared with high plant diversity plots, interaction webs based on low plant diversity plots showed reduced complexity in terms of total connectance, interaction diversity and mean interaction strength. Plant diversity effects obviously cascade up the food web and modify interactions across all trophic levels. The strongest effects occurred in interactions between adjacent trophic levels (i.e. predominantly trophic interactions), while significant interactions among plant and carnivore functional groups, as well as horizontal interactions (i.e. interactions between functional groups of the same trophic level), showed rather inconsistent responses and were generally rarer. 4. Reduced interaction diversity has the potential to decrease and destabilize ecosystem processes. Therefore, we conclude that the loss of basal producer species leads to more simple structured, less and more loosely connected species assemblages, which in turn are very likely to decrease ecosystem functioning, community robustness and tolerance to disturbance.

Do the impacts of ungulates on exotic vs native plants depend on forest management activities such as prescribed fire and stand thinning? Location: Northeastern Oregon, USA. Methods: We recorded changes in richness and cover of different exotic and native plant life forms in experimental plots that were grazed only by cattle (a non-native herbivore), only by elk (a native herbivore) or not grazed by any ungulate over a 7-yr period at both managed (recently burned and thinned) and unmanaged (where no fire and thinning has occurred in >40 yr) forest stands. Results: There was a general decrease in exotic plant species richness and cover across all treatments. However, the decrease in exotic richness, particularly of exotic annual forbs, was slightly lower in plots grazed by elk than in ungrazed plots at managed stands. Managed stands also displayed a larger increase in native annual forb richness and exotic graminoid richness, and a larger decrease in native perennial graminoid cover with cattle grazing than elk grazing. At unmanaged stands, cover of woody native plants such as shrubs, sub-shrubs and trees as well as native perennial forbs decreased or remained relatively constant with elk grazing while increasing strongly at plots that were ungrazed or grazed by cattle. Conclusions: Cattle and elk have variable effects on different plant guilds at managed vs unmanaged forest stands. Overall, cattle grazing tends to have a larger impact on herbaceous plant guilds at managed stands, while elk grazing tends to have a larger impact on woody plant guilds at unmanaged stands. However, in contrast to findings from other ecosystems, grazing only has a minor impact on exotic plant dynamics in our study area, and cattle grazing does not favour exotic plants any more than grazing by elk or ungulate exclusion.",###,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/avsc.12194,106,Jana,,No,"No ecosystem functions (besides grazing, which was manipulated)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
165,"Cropland patchiness strongest agricultural predictor of bird diversity for multiple guilds in landscapes of Ontario, Canada","Frei, B; Bennett, EM; Kerr, JT",REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE,Agriculture; Biodiversity; Breeding Bird Atlas; Composition; Configuration; Landscape diversity,"The potential for agricultural landscapes to support biodiversity may vary greatly based on agricultural land use. Current knowledge suggests that agricultural composition and intensity are dominant drivers of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes, with variable effects of agricultural configuration and landscape diversity. The aim of this study was to determine the relative effects of agricultural composition, intensity, configuration, and landscape diversity on the species diversity of six distinct bird guilds on the landscape scale in a large and complex landscape in Ontario, Canada. We found that agricultural configuration, specifically patchiness of croplands, and to a lesser degree forage lands, was the strongest predictor of bird diversity for three of the six bird guilds considered (forest, shrubland, and town). The effects of increased cropland patchiness were variable, with forest and shrubland bird diversity increasing from small to moderate patchiness, and town bird diversity declining from moderate to high patchiness. Grassland birds, a group of considerable conservation concern, increased near linearly with increased agricultural land cover in the landscape, highlighting the need to consider agricultural lands in conservation planning for this species group. Woodland bird diversity declined significantly with all increasing measures of agricultural intensity, including the proportion of high-intensity agriculture and larger patches of agricultural land. Wetland birds were unique from the other guilds, showing primarily a strong association between diversity of land cover types and guild-level bird diversity. Surprisingly, increased cover of agricultural lands, which we predicted to be a dominant driver of guild-level bird diversity declines due to habitat loss, had weak, non-significant effects relative to the other land use variable being tested, except for the positive association with grassland birds. Our findings suggest that a mix of management strategies should be employed to consider the varying effects of agricultural lands on different bird guilds, such as the inclusion of agricultural land in conservation strategies for grassland species and further managing the configuration of agricultural lands to enhance biodiversity of agricultural landscapes.",###,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-018-1343-5,107,Jana,,No,No ecosystem functions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These bottom-up effects may involve important ecological processes that affect pest control. For example, population densities of natural enemies may increase when alternative preys are favoured by a new resource. 2 Ants, particularly Solenopsis geminata Forel (Myrmicinae), are recognized as effective predators of herbivores eggs. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the addition of a primary resource in a banana agroecosystem will increase pest control of the banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus Germar (Coleoptera, Curculionidae) by ants. 3 Using stable isotope analyses, we showed that S. geminata used the new resource pathway provided by the addition of a cover crop. This change was revealed by increased d13C values (13C/12C) in a cover crop treatment (C4 plant) compared with a banana (C3 plant) in bare soil treatment. 4 We also showed that the abundance of S. geminata, as measured with pitfall traps, was 4.85.4-fold higher in the cover crop treatment than in the bare soil treatment. Estimation of egg predation rates was in the range 7.870.3%, which occurred in plots with the lowest and highest S. geminata numbers, respectively. 5 The addition of a new primary resource in this system changed the origin of the carbon consumed by predators and increased their densities. The increased ant abundance resulted in increased predation of weevil eggs, which was consistent with our hypothesis. These results will be useful for the design of cropping systems that enhance the biological regulation of pests.",###,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-9563.2012.00571.x,108,Jana,,No,No biodiversity (just increase in one ant species achieved by using one cover crop species in banana plantation),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
167,Alternative prey and farming system mediate predation of Colorado potato beetles by generalists,"Lynch, CA; Smith, OM; Chapman, EG; Crossley, MS; Crowder, DW; Fu, Z; Harwood, JD; Jensen, AS; Krey, KL; Snyder, GB; Snyder, WE",PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,predator-predator interference; alternative prey; complementarity; feeding niches; organic farming,"BACKGROUND Biological control by generalist predators can be mediated by the abundance and biodiversity of alternative prey. When alternative prey draw predator attacks away from the control target, they can weaken pest suppression. In other cases, a diverse prey base can promote predator abundance and biodiversity, reduce predator-predator interference, and benefit biocontrol. Here, we used molecular gut-content analysis to assess how community composition altered predation of Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say)) by Nabis sp. and Geocoris sp. Predators were collected from organic or conventional potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) fields, encouraging differences in arthropod community composition. RESULTS In organic fields, Nabis predation of potato beetles decreased with increasing arthropod richness and predator abundance. This is consistent with Nabis predators switching to other prey species when available and with growing predator-predator interference. In conventional fields these patterns were reversed, however, with potato beetle predation by Nabis increasing with greater arthropod richness and predator abundance. For Geocoris, Colorado potato beetle predation was more frequent in organic than in conventional fields. However, Geocoris predation of beetles was less frequent in fields with higher abundance of the detritus-feeding fly Scaptomyza pallida Zetterstedt, or of all arthropods, consistent with predators choosing other prey when available. CONCLUSION Alternative prey generally dampened predation of potato beetles, suggesting these pests were less-preferred prey. Nabis and Geocoris differed in which alternative prey were most disruptive to feeding on potato beetles, and in the effects of farm management on predation, consistent with the two predator species occupying complementary feeding niches.",###,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.6553,109,Jana,,Yes,NA,field observation,"Land use intensity:  organic vs conventional agriculture in fielsd, landscape/farm level",Land use intensity,Organic/non-organic,Organic/non-organic,,NA,predation/parasitism,predation,predation rate,predation,"predation of potato beetles, DNa in molecular git content analysis",service,rate,rate,3,AG,herb,negative,"species richness of arthropods, abundance of predator)",No,NA,indirect,via land use,"2,3,4",consumers,consumers,consumers,invertebrates,arthropods,arthropods,species,richness,richness,positive,"model selection, GLMM","Table 1, 2",NA,NA,No,NA,NA,NA,No,NA,NA,No,No,land use factors,land use,organic vs conventional (negative vs positive BEF),croplands,commercial potato fields,North America,USA,USA,,,No management tests
168,Multitrophic effects of nutrient addition in upland grassland,"Fountain, MT; Brown, VK; Gange, AC; Symondson, WOC; Murray, PJ",BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH,bottom-up; Collembola; community structure; lime; nitrogen; spiders,"Although the effects of nutrient enhancement on aquatic systems are well documented, the consequences of nutritional supplements on soil food webs are poorly understood, and results of past research examining bottom-up effects are often conflicting. In addition, many studies have failed to separate the effects of nutrient enrichment and the physical effects of adding organic matter. In this field study, we hypothesised that the addition of nitrogen to soil would result in a trophic cascade, through detritivores (Collembola) to predators (spiders), increasing invertebrate numbers and diversity. Nitrogen and lime were added to plots in an upland grassland in a randomised block design. Populations of Collembola and spiders were sampled by means of pitfall traps and identified to species. Seventeen species of Collembola were identified from the nitrogen plus lime (N + L) and control plots. Species assemblage, diversity, richness, evenness and total number were not affected by nutrient additions. However, there was an increase in the number of Isotomidae juveniles and Parisotoma anglicana trapped in the N + L plots. Of the 44 spider species identified, over 80% were Linyphiidae. An effect on species assemblage from the addition of N + L to the plots was observed on two of the four sampling dates (July 2002 and June 2003). The linyphiid, Oedothorax retusus, was the only species significantly affected by the treatments and was more likely to be trapped in the control plots. The increased number of juvenile Collembola, and change in community composition of spiders, were consequences of the bottom-up effect caused by nutrient inputs. However, despite efforts to eliminate the indirect effects of nutrient inputs, a reduction in soil moisture in the N + L plots cannot be eliminated as a cause of the invertebrate population changes observed. Even so, this experiment was not confounded by the physical effects of habitat structure reported in most previous studies. It provides evidence of moderate bottom-up influences of epigeic soil invertebrate food webs and distinguishes between nutrient addition and plant physical structure effects. It also emphasises the importance Of understanding the effects of soil management practices on soil biodiversity, which is under increasing pressure from land development and food production.",###,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S000748530700555X,110,Jana,,No,No ecosystem functions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ants are ubiquitous components of terrestrial systems but their contributions to natural prey suppression is relatively understudied in temperate regions. Growing evidence suggests that ants can play a significant role in the removal of insect prey within grasslands, but their impact is difficult to separate from that of nonant predators. To test how ants may contribute to prey suppression in grasslands, we used poison baits (with physical exclosures) to selectively reduce the ant population in common garden settings, then tracked ant and nonant ground predator abundance and diversity, and removal of sentinel egg prey for 7 wk. We found that poison baits reduced ant abundance without a significant negative impact on abundance of nonant ground predators, and that a reduction in ant abundance decreased the proportion of sentinel prey eggs removed. Even a modest decrease (similar to 20%) in abundance of several ant species, including the numerically dominant Lasius neoniger Emery (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), significantly reduced sentinel prey removal rates. Our results suggest that ants disproportionately contribute to ground-based predation of arthropod prey in grasslands. Changes in the amount of grasslands on the landscape and its management may have important implications for ant prevalence and natural prey suppression services in agricultural landscapes.",###,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/nvz127,111,Jana,,No,"Experimental ant reduction in common garden does not change ant diversity (but does change ant predation), no agricultural management action",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, intraguild predation, where predators compete for the same prey resource whilst consuming each other, may destabilize population dynamics and increase the risk of pest outbreaks. Very little is known about intraguild predation in open fields or the strengths of trophic links between predators which may negatively affect pest control. We tested the null hypothesis that predation by the epigeal predator Pterostichus melanarius (Coleoptera: Carabidae) on different spiders is species-independent (proportional to density). A combination of population monitoring in winter wheat, molecular identification of juvenile spiders, molecular analysis of predator gut contents and a Monte Carlo simulation model were used to analyse prey choice. Pterostichus melanarius were pitfall-trapped over three months, and 622 individuals were screened for the remains of four spider species. Predation rates on spiders were 43 center dot 6% in June and 33 center dot 3% in August and showed clear evidence of prey choice. Predation on the web-dependent Tenuiphantes tenuis (Linyphiidae) was significantly greater than predicted from a random choice model, while predation on Bathyphantes gracilis (Linyphiidae) was significantly lower. The beetles may be selecting the most abundant species disproportionately (switching) or responding in some cases to spatial niche separation (T. tenuis locate their webs marginally lower than B. gracilis). However, two itinerant hunters, Erigone spp. (Linyphiidae) and Pachygnatha degeeri (Tetragnathidae), were consumed in proportion to their density. Synthesis and applications. High levels of intraguild predation were revealed using molecular diagnostics. The gut analysis approach provided invaluable data that will inform the future design of appropriate pest management and integrated farming strategies that encourage these predators. The data showed strong evidence of prey choice. Managers can, however, probably encourage high densities of all these known aphid predators (spiders and carabids) because disproportionately high rates of predation on the most common spiders at our field sites (T. tenuis) were not sufficient to prevent strong growth in the density of this species between June and August (adults increasedx1 center dot 6 and juvenilesx8 center dot 6).

Ground beetles and arachnids were sampled throughout the year and we analyzed summer data conjointly to assess potential differences in the activity-density of these major predators between treatments. We found significantly higher predation potential in June in all agroforestry treatments compared to the control. In August, however, no differences were observed. Ground beetles and Opiliones were the major predators involved in observed predation events at both sampling periods. Differences in predation potential in June (- 35% in the control compared to agroforestry treatments) could be due to differences in Pterostichus madidus and Opiliones activity-density, which may have increased due to warmer temperatures under trees compared to the control plot.",###,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2018.10.009,114,Jana,,No,No biodiversity (only activity density of predator species),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These effects may reach a higher magnitude in highly altered habitats, for example in wetlands transformed into rice paddies. This is the case for the amphibian species of the genus Hynobius in the Republic of Korea, which originally breed in slow streams and valleys. However, a comparatively high proportion of the natural breeding sites used by the species in the lowlands has been transformed into rice paddies. Here, we assessed whether anthropogenic modification of wetlands leads to an additional threat to breeding Hynobius spp. in the form of increased vulnerability of their egg clutches to loach predators (Misgurnus species) in such modified habitats. We conducted weekly occurrence surveys at 27 randomly selected sites in the Republic of Korea and recorded the following information: type of site (natural versus agricultural), air temperature, water conductivity, moon phase and predation by Misgurnus sp. Our results reveal, for the first time, cases of predation of Hynobius spp. eggs by Misgurnus loaches. We also show that the risk of predation was higher in agricultural sites in comparison to natural sites. In conclusion, we demonstrate the increased predation risk of Hynobius spp. eggs by Misgurnus sp. at anthropogenically disturbed sites, and thus a new type of threat to Hynobius populations. This new type of threat may, however, be due to expansion of the breeding habitats following human disruptions to landscapes.

Recently, there has been a paradigm shift away from harvesting peat as a fuel towards the development of wettable peatland innovation (termed 'paludiculture'), such as aquaculture. Such eco-innovations support carbon sequestration and align with a balanced en-vironmental approach to protecting biodiversity. This novel peatland-based IMTA process in the Irish midlands relies upon natural microalgae for waste treatment, recirculation and water quality where there is no use of pesticides or an-tibiotics. This novel IMTA system is powered with a wind turbine and the process has 'organic status'; moreover, it does not discharge aquaculture effluent to receiving water. However, there is a significant lack of understanding as to diver-sity of microalgae in this 'paludiculture'-based IMTA processes. This constitutes the first case study to use conventional microscopy combined with next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics to profile microalgae occurring in this novel IMTA system from pooled samples over a 12 month period in 2020. Conventional microscopy combined with classic identification revealed twenty genera of algae; with Chlorophyta and Charophyta being the most common pres-ent. However, algal DNA isolation, 16 s sequencing and bioinformatics revealed a combined total of 982 species from 341 genera across nine phyla from the same IMTA system, which emphasized a significant underestimation in the number and diversity of beneficial or potentially harmful algae in the IMTA-microbiome.

However, more species can also increase negative interactions such as intraguild predation (IGP), which could be detrimental to pest control. Direct observations of these trophic interactions are still lacking. In the present study, we employed DNA-based gut content analyses of coccinellid beetles to assess IGP (direct and coincidental) and aphid consumption. Species-specific and group-specific primer pairs were used to unveil the interactions of the most abundant coccinellid species, three cereal aphids and their associated parasitoids. In order to determine whether the landscape complexity promotes these interactions, we used replicated wheat fields in two contrasting landscape contexts over the season in central Chile. With higher abundance of coccinellids, we observed greater aphid consumption in complex contexts. The consumption of parasitized aphids was mostly detected early in complex contexts, suggesting a detrimental effect on the parasitoid population. Following molecular analysis, we can state that the aphids are important feeding resources for the coccinellid assemblage and are actively foraging on this important pest. Finally, this study demonstrates that direct IGP is a common interaction in this system, independently of the landscape context during the complete season. Nevertheless, the native Eriopis chilensis was found to be the most frequently consumed intraguild prey. In contrast with expected predictions, we found little evidence that the landscape context increased negative interactions, such as IGP and IGP-C and in turn that these decrease the control of Sitobion avenae.",###,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10340-019-01142-4,118,Jana,,No,No biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The idea that diversity stabilizes functional properties of communities to environmental perturbation is formalized in the ecological literature as the insurance hypothesis. Recently this hypothesis has been examined theoretically and in microcosm experiments. However it has not been tested empirically in an agroecosystem. Here we provide a test of the insurance hypothesis by examining insect predation by birds in coffee farms with different levels of plant diversity.

The idea that diversity stabilizes functional properties of communities to environmental perturbation is formalized in the ecological literature as the insurance hypothesis. Recently this hypothesis has been examined theoretically and in microcosm experiments. However it has not been tested empirically in an agroecosystem. Here we provide a test of the insurance hypothesis by examining insect predation by birds in coffee farms with different levels of plant diversity. Lepidopteran larvae were placed in coffee plants, and larval disappearance rates were measured within and outside bird exclosures in two farms with distinct levels of shade.

181,Smaller and Isolated Grassland Fragments Are Exposed to Stronger Seed and Insect Predation in Habitat Edges,"Kuli-Revesz, K; Koranyi, D; Lakatos, T; Szabo, AR; Batary, P; Galle, R",FORESTS,arthropod predation; connectivity; dummy caterpillar; ecosystem function; edge effect; forest-steppe; fragment size; kurgan; landscape-scale; seed predation,"Habitat fragmentation threatens terrestrial arthropod biodiversity, and thereby also leads to alterations of ecosystem functioning and stability. Predation on insects and seeds by arthropods are two very important ecological functions because of their community-structuring effects. We addressed the effect of fragment connectivity, fragment size, and edge effect on insect and seed predation of arthropods. We studied 60 natural fragments of two grassland ecosystems in the same region (Hungarian Great Plain), 30 forest-steppes, and 30 burial mounds (kurgans). The size of fragments were in the range of 0.16-6.88 ha for forest-steppe and 0.01-0.44 ha for kurgan. We used 2400 sentinel arthropod preys (dummy caterpillars) and 4800 seeds in trays for the measurements. Attack marks on dummy caterpillars were used for predator identification and calculation of insect predation rates. In the case of seeds, predation rates were calculated as the number of missing or damaged seeds per total number of exposed seeds. Increasing connectivity played a role only in generally small kurgans, with a negative effect on insect and seed predation rates in the edges. In contrast, fragment size moderated edge effects on insect and seed predation rates in generally large forest-steppes. The difference between edges and centres was more pronounced in small than in large fragments. Our study emphasizes the important role of landscape and fragment-scale factors interacting with edge effect in shaping ecosystem functions in natural grassland fragments of modified landscapes. Managing functional landscapes to optimize the assessment of ecosystem functions and services needs a multispatial scale approach.",###,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f12010054,121,Jana,,No,No diversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
182,Structural complexity of arthropod guilds is affected by the agricultural landscape heterogeneity generated by fencerows,"Molina, GAR; Poggio, SL; Ghersa, CM",ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY,Boundary; carabid beetles; dispersal; field margin; natural enemies; Rolling Pampas; trophic interactions,"Intensive farming imposes harsh conditions impeding the persistence of most arthropod species within crop fields. Hence, arthropods surviving the unfavourable conditions prevailing within crop fields may disperse towards nearby uncropped margins, such as fencerows. Here, we evaluate the influence of landscape heterogeneity on the abundance of different guilds, particularly herbivores and their natural enemies. Said heterogeneity mostly derives from fencerow network density. Hence, we developed an approach based on fitting linear-mixed models to elucidate the effects of landscape heterogeneity and field position (fencerows and crop interiors) on arthropod diversity. Mixed models were fitted to arthropod data obtained by pitfall trap samplings in 36 crop fields. Arthropod communities were structurally and functionally more complex along fencerows than within nearby crop interiors. Arthropods abundance was modulated by landscape heterogeneity, increasing the abundance of natural enemies as the landscape heterogeneity increased. On the contrary, herbivores abundance decreased as landscape heterogeneity increased. Consequently, the ratio between herbivores and natural enemies also decreased as landscapes became more heterogeneous. Natural enemies with larger body sizes, mostly carabid beetles, were more sensitive to landscape homogenisation. Our study reveals that, despite the coarse-grained landscapes in the Rolling Pampa, fencerow density appears as a key factor for structuring complex arthropod guilds in intensively farmed agricultural mosaics. In landscapes with higher density of fencerows, arthropods tend to concentrate along them, thus increasing the community structural complexity as well as the predation pressure over herbivores. This structural complexity of upper trophic levels enhances the top-down' regulation of herbivore populations, consequently decreasing the probability of pest outbreaks within crop fields.",###,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aab.12253,122,Jana,,No,No ecosystem functions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

191,"Optimizing environmental measures for landscape multifunctionality: Effectiveness, efficiency and recommendations for agri-environmental programs","Galler, C; von Haaren, C; Albert, C",J ENVIRON MANAGE,Multifunctionality; Environmental planning; Agri-environmental measures; Landscape functions; Ecosystem services; Trade-off; Economic,"Agri-environmental measures differ in their capacity to simultaneously enhance the provision of multiple ecosystem services. Multifunctional approaches are hampered by funding schemes that are usually administered by individual administrative sectors that each predominantly focus on one single environmental objective. Developing integrative management strategies that exploit synergies from implementing multifunctional measures is challenged by the need to quantify expected management effects on different ecosystem services. The objective of this paper is to compare uncoordinated versus coordinated management strategies in their contribution to multiple environmental objectives. We developed and applied a method for quantifying effectiveness, as well as spatial and cost efficiency with respect to four key landscape functions: erosion prevention, water quality conservation, climate change mitigation and safeguarding biodiversity. The case study area was the county of Verden, Germany. The following findings can be drawn: Measures for safeguarding biodiversity and climate change mitigation have generally high multifunctional effects, which makes them suitable for integrative management strategies. To make use of the added value of potential multifunctional measures, a spatially targeted allocation of agri-environmental measures is necessary. Compared to uncoordinated strategies, coordinated integrative management strategies either allow the optimization, of the ratio of costs to environmental effects or an increase in the effects that can be achieved within an area unit. This is however, usually not simultaneous. Future research should seek to refine the assessment and valuation indicators. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it is unclear which forest types provide which ecosystem services and to what extent forests primarily managed for timber already supply multiple ecosystem services. Based on a comprehensive dataset collected across 150 forest plots in three regions differing in management intensity and species composition, we develop models to predict the potential supply of 13 ecosystem services. We use those models to assess the level of multifunctionality of managed forests at the national level using national forest inventory data. Results Looking at the potential supply of ecosystem services, we found trade-offs (e.g. between both bark beetle control or dung decomposition and both productivity or soil carbon stocks) as well as synergies (e.g. for temperature regulation, carbon storage and culturally interesting plants) across the 53 most dominant forest types in Germany. No single forest type provided all ecosystem services equally. Some ecosystem services showed comparable levels across forest types (e.g. decomposition or richness of saprotrophs), while others varied strongly, depending on forest structural attributes (e.g. phosphorous availability or cover of edible plants) or tree species composition (e.g. potential nitrification activity). Variability in potential supply of ecosystem services was only to a lesser extent driven by environmental conditions. However, the geographic variation in ecosystem function supply across Germany was closely linked with the distribution of main tree species. Conclusions Our results show that forest multifunctionality is limited to subsets of ecosystem services. The importance of tree species composition highlights that a lack of multifunctionality at the stand level can be compensated by managing forests at the landscape level, when stands of complementary forest types are combined. These results imply that multi-purpose forestry should be based on a variety of forest types requiring coordinated planning across larger spatial scales.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40663-021-00280-5,125,Oksana,,No ,No multifunctionality & No functions on higher trophic levels,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we assessed biodiversity, functional composition and 14 ecosystem services on 150 agricultural grasslands differing in land-use intensity. We also introduce five multifunctionality measures in which ecosystem services were weighted according to realistic land-use objectives. We found that indirect land-use effects, i.e. those mediated by biodiversity loss and by changes to functional composition, were as strong as direct effects on average. Their strength varied with land-use objectives and regional context. Biodiversity loss explained indirect effects in a region of intermediate productivity and was most damaging when land-use objectives favoured supporting and cultural services.

Over recent decades, the permanent grassland area has declined and land use change continues to threaten its extent. Simultaneously, the management intensity of permanent grasslands increased. We performed a systematic literature review on the multifunctionality of permanent grasslands in Europe, examining the effects of land use and management on 19 grassland ecosystem service indicators. Based on the evidence in 696 out of 70,456 screened papers, published since 1980, we found that both land use change and intensification of management decreased multifunctionality. In particular, preventing conversion of permanent grasslands to croplands secured the delivery of multiple ecosystem services. A lower management intensity was associated with benefits for biodiversity, climate regulation and water purification, but impacted the provision of high-quality animal feed. Increasing the number of species in the sward enhanced multifunctionality of permanent grassland without significant trade-offs such as losses in production. Our review covered many aspects of land use, management and ecosystem services, but we also identified areas with no or only few studies. The most prominent gaps were related to comparisons between permanent and temporary grasslands, and effects of management practices on the provision of cultural values, and on erosion and flood control. We suggest that, despite apparent changes in human dietary preferences, the protection of permanent grasslands in Europe must be prioritised.

Establishing trade-offs and synergies between traits and services has largely relied on meta-analyses of studies from different systems and environments. This study demonstrated the value of focused studies of long-term experiments in grassland systems that measure traits and services in the same space and time to better understand the ecological constraints underlying these trade-offs and synergies. An analysis is presented that uses data from the Park Grass Experiment at Rothamsted Research on above-ground productivity, species richness and soil organic carbon stocks to quantify the relationships between these three outcomes and the power of variance in plant functional traits in explaining them. There was a trade-off between plots with high productivity, nitrogen inputs and soil organic carbon and plots with high species richness that was explained by a functional gradient of traits that are indicative of contrasting strategies of resource acquisition of resource conservation. Examples were identified of using functional traits to identify opportunities for mitigating these trade-offs and moving toward more multifunctional systems. (C) The Author(s) 2022.

To address this challenge, we followed the functional land management approach and assessed five soil functions: primary productivity, water regulation and purification, climate regulation, soil biodiversity and nutrient cycling. Soil, management and climate data were collected from 94 sites covering 13 countries, five climatic zones and two land-use types (arable and grassland). This dataset was analysed using the Soil Navigator, a multicriteria decision support system developed to assess the supply of the five soil functions simultaneously. Most sites scored high for two to three soil functions, demonstrating that managing for multifunctionality in soil is possible but that local constraints and trade-offs do exist. Nutrient cycling, biodiversity and climate regulation were less frequently delivered at high capacity than the other two soil functions. Using correlation and co-occurrence analyses, we also found that synergies and trade-offs between soil functions vary among climatic zones and land-use types. This study provides a new framework for monitoring soil quality at the European scale where both the supply of soil functions and their interactions are considered. Highlights Managing and monitoring soil multifunctionality across Europe is possible. Synergies and trade-offs between soil functions exist, making it difficult to maximize the supply of all five soil functions simultaneously.

This study compared the effects of continuous cover forestry and conventional rotation forestry on ecosystem services and biodiversity in boreal forests in Finland. We simulated over 25,000 commercial forest stands for 100 years under continuous cover and rotation forest management. Forests without management were used as a reference. We compared the effects of silvicultural practices over space and time on ecosystem services, biodiversity indicators and multifunctionality. Our results revealed that continuous cover forestry was better than rotation forest management in terms of timber net present value, carbon sequestration, bilberry production, scenic beauty and the number of large trees. It provided higher habitat availability for indicator species dependent on deciduous trees and mature forest structure. Rotation forest management was better than continuous cover forestry in terms of harvested tree biomass, cowberries, mushrooms, and species dependent on high tree volume. In general, multifunctionality was higher in continuous cover forests than in rotation forests. Therefore, continuous cover forests may have a greater potential to produce simultaneously multiple benefits from forests. However, unmanaged forests often provided the highest levels of services and biodiversity making their role indispensable in delivering forest related ecosystem services and, especially, in the maintenance of biodiversity.

Understanding the relative importance of climate change and overgrazing on ecosystems services is critical for predicting the effects of global change on ecosystem well-being. We generated a system-level understanding of the effects of climate (aridity intensity) and land use intensification (herbivore grazing intensity) on four regulating ecosystem services (C-storage, N-availability and P-availability, and organic matter decomposition) and one provisioning service (plant production) in wooded drylands from eastern Australia. Climate change and grazing intensity had different effects on multiple ecosystem services. Increasing aridity from 0.19 (dry subhumid) to 0.63 (arid) had consistent suppressive effects on C-storage, N-availability, decomposition and plant biomass services, but not on P-availability. The magnitude of these suppressive effects was greater than any effects due to grazing. All sites showed evidence of kangaroo grazing, but the heaviest grazing was due to cattle (dung: range 0-4545 kg ha(-1); mean 142 kg ha(-1)). Any effects of grazing on ecosystem services were herbivore specific and ranged from positive to neutral or negative. Sheep, and to a lesser extent cattle, were associated with greater N-availability. Rabbits, however, had a greater effect on P-availability than aridity. Our study suggests that increases in livestock grazing may fail to sustain ecosystem services because of the generally stronger negative effect of increasing aridity on most ecosystem services in our model dryland. These services are likely therefore to decline with global increases in aridity.

Less is known about the individual and combined effects of biodiversity components above-and-below-ground on ecosystem multifunctionality. The aim of this study was to explore how different management regimes influence multifunctionality via modification of both plant and soil microbial (bacterial and fungal) diversity. Methods We used a 6-year experiment in Inner Mongolian grassland to compare multifunctionality and separate functions related to the C, N, P cycles and plant productivity under four management regimes and examine relationships between these functions and different components of biodiversity, both above- and belowground. Results Ecosystem multifunctionality and the rates of nutrient cycling and plant productivity, were greatest under moderate grazing intensity, and lowest under no grazing. Further, across all management regimes, multifunctionality was positively related to plant diversity, and plant and soil microbial diversity combined explained a much greater (62.5%) proportion of variance in multifunctionality than that did either component alone. Different components of biodiversity showed contrasting relationships with individual functions: plant diversity was positively related to C and N cycling, whereas bacterial diversity was negatively related to P cycling and plant productivity. Conclusions Moderate grazing has better outcomes for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem multifunctionality than mowing and cessation of grazing.

We used phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) method to determine the diversity and composition of soil microbial communities. The relationships among LUI, plant diversity (species and functional diversity), soil microbial diversity (bacterial and eukaryotic diversity), and soil microbial composition (fungi/bacteria and Gram-positive/Gram-negative bacteria ratios), and SMF were examined. The LUI affected SMF indirectly by reducing plant diversity and its interaction with soil bacterial diversity.

A landscape multifunctionality assessment for the European Union under conditions of land use change,"Sturck, J; Verburg, PH",LANDSCAPE ECOL,Ecosystem services; Land use change; Multifunctional; Spatial scale; Europe; Scenarios,"The provision of multiple ecosystem services (ES) within a landscape is commonly referred to as landscape multifunctionality. Modifying landscapes to increase multifunctionality and reduce trade-offs with concurrent services bears the potential to enhance sustainability in human-dominated landscapes. Assessing landscape multifunctionality is thus crucial for land management and planning, but lack of a clear definition and operationalization of multifunctionality impedes comparisons of different study results. We want to address how elements of the study design affect results of multifunctionality assessments. Furthermore, we want to quantify future multifunctionality in the European Union (EU) and indicate the role of land use change and land use diversity on multifunctionality. We analyzed diverging scenarios depicting land use change in the EU between 2000 and 2040 for their effects on landscape multifunctionality. We tested different multifunctionality indicators at various spatial scales based on the modelling of 12 ES and biodiversity indicators. Particularly the analysis scale determines the interpretation of landscape multifunctionality. Coldspots identified by different indicators are in higher agreement than hotspots. We could not confirm links between land use diversity and landscape multifunctionality. While, at EU scale, multifunctionality slightly increases in future scenarios, agricultural intensification and (peri-)urban growth pose large threats to multifunctional landscapes. The choice of indicator and analysis scale strongly determine possible interpretations of the results. Rather than focusing on the impacts of land use change on multifunctionality, it is recommended to base land use policy on the impacts of location-specific change on ES supply and demands.",2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-016-0459-6,139,Oksana,,No,"No ecosystem functions (only diversity indicies used for calculating multifunctionality), modelling paper",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stakeholders have different expectations and demands on the functionality and services of vegetated strips. In our review, we focused on biodiversity and the ecosystem services pollination, conservation biocontrol, landscape aesthetics, buffer function, and biomass production and their associated functions. We assessed factors that are crucial to support service provision and reviewed trade-offs between the ecosystem (dis)services. We identified five characteristics that are important for the provision of the assessed ecosystem services: age of vegetated strips, flower cover, size or width of the strip, management, and type of adjacent habitat. We conclude that adjusting the target of subsidies with respect to the analyzed factors for biodiversity can help to promote the multifunctionality of vegetated strips in arable farming.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4229,140,Oksana,,No,Literature review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With increasing land use intensity, soil biogeochemical and microbial characteristics change significantly and may affect the multifunctionality of ecosystems. The relationship between soil microbial communities and resistance of multiple ecosystem functions under land-use change has not previously been assessed in the karst regions. Soils from four karst ecosystems (primary forest, secondary forest, abandoned land and cultivated land) were analyzed for microbial communities as predictor of multifunctional resistance to land use change by using high-throughput sequencing, structural equation modeling and random forest modeling. We evaluated the multifunctional resistance of soil ecosystems by measuring indicators related to soil carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling. The resistance of Proteobacteria was the highest in the secondary forest, and that of Verrucomicrobia was the highest in the abandoned and cultivated lands. With increasing land-use intensity, C-cycling functional resistance decreased by 77% and nitrogen functional resistance increased by 17% in the abandoned land, compared with those in the secondary forest. Bacterial communities had the largest direct positive effect on multifunctional resistance and N-related functional resistance. Among bacterial communities, Verrucomicrobia and Chloroflexi were the two most important phyla that affected soil multifunctional resistance. Armatimonadetes_unclassified, Chloroflexia and OPB35_soil_group were the best predictor of total organic carbon, total nitrogen and total phosphorus content, respectively. Our results suggested strong links between microbial community composition and multifunctional resistance in various karst ecosystems, and provided insights into the importance of microbial community composition in the recovery of ecosystems following human intervention.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejsobi.2021.103313,141,Oksana,,No,No biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, partitioning the relative influence of various biodiversity attributes, namely taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity, on EMF during secondary succession is still unclear. This study aimed to bridge the gap by employing field measurements and the chronosequence approach at 21 plots with different stand ages and precipitation conditions on the Loess Plateau of China. For diversity indices, we calculated the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Simpson's dominance index, Pielou evenness index, community weighted mean (CWM), functional variance (FDvar), and Faith's phylogenetic diversity (PD) based on the empirically measured composition and traits of plant species. The EMF was expressed as the averaged value of eight function variables (including aboveground biomass, root biomass, soil total carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus content, soil organic carbon, available nitrogen and available phosphorus content). The results showed that species evenness and CWM of leaf dry matter content (LDMC) significantly increased yet the CWM of specific leaf area (SLA) decreased with stand age, indicating the resource-use strategy of the plants became more conservative through succession into its later stages. The EMF increased with both stand age and mean annual precipitation. The structural equation model revealed that stand age, soil water content (SWC), and the multiple diversity indices altogether accounted for 56.0% of the variation in the EMF. PD and the CWMs of plant height and LDMC had positive effects on the EMF, and the FDvar of leaf nitrogen had negative effects on EMF.

However, it remains unclear how biodiversity regulates EMF changes in response to intensive grazing. Location Global. Time period From 1992 to 2018. Major taxa studied Grassland. Methods Here, we conducted a global synthesis using 373 paired observations from 90 published studies to address the responses of plant diversity, EMF and their relationships to grazing disturbance depending on grazing intensity, livestock type, grazing duration, and climatic aridity. Results Our results showed that EMF significantly decreased with increasing grazing intensity, but the negative EMF response was alleviated at high levels of plant diversity. The grazing-induced changes in EMF increased linearly with the changes in plant diversity, with the slopes increasing by 78.9% from light to heavy grazing. In addition, the grazing-induced decrease of EMF was stronger with longer grazing duration and more arid climates. Structural equation models suggested that grazing intensity reduced EMF largely via decreasing plant diversity, whereas upsizing livestock type promoted EMF by increasing plant diversity.

We know little about how the interactions between biodiversity and environmental factors affect EMF. In this case study, a structural equation model was used to clarify climatic and geographic pathways that affect EMF by varying biodiversity in the Tibetan alpine grasslands. In addition to services related to carbon, nitrogen, and water cycling, forage supply, which is related to plant productivity and palatability, was included in the EMF index. The results showed that 72% of the variation in EMF could be explained by biodiversity and other environmental factors. The ratio of palatable richness to all species richness explained 8.3% of the EMF variation. We found that air temperature, elevation, and latitude all affected EMF, but in different ways. Air temperature and elevation impacted the aboveground parts of the ecosystem, which included plant height, aboveground biomass, richness of palatable species, and ratio of palatable richness to all species richness. Latitude affected EMF by varying both aboveground and belowground parts of the ecosystem, which included palatable species richness and belowground biomass.

Agricultural intensification and its focus on increasing primary productivity (PP) poses a threat to soil quality, due to increases in nutrient loads, greenhouse gas emissions and declining biodiversity. The EU Horizon 2020 Landmark project has developed multi-criteria decision models to assess five soil functions: PP, nutrient cycling (NC), soil biodiversity and habitat provision (B-HP), climate mitigation and water regulation, simultaneously in agricultural fields. Using these algorithms, we evaluated the supply of PP, NC and B-HP of 31 grasslands and 21 croplands as low, medium or high. The multi-criteria decision models showed that 38% of the farms had a medium to high supply of all three soil functions, whereas only one cropland had a high supply for all three. Forty-eight per cent of the farms were characterized by a high supply of PP and NC. We observed a clear trade-off between these two functions and B-HP. Multivariate statistical analyses indicated that higher organic inputs combined with a lower mineral fertilization concur with higher biodiversity scores while maintaining a medium delivery of PP and NC. Additionally, we compared the outputs of the model predictions to independent variables that served as proxies for the soil functions and found: (a) croplands (but not grasslands) with high PP had a higher standardized yield than those with medium PP; (b) grasslands (but not croplands) with high NC had a significantly lower fungal to bacterial biomass ratio, suggesting faster decomposition channels; and (c) a positive though non-significant trend between B-HP score and rank according to soil invertebrate biodiversity. These comparisons suggest a successful upscaling of the models from field to farm level. Our study highlights the need for systematic collection of management-related data for the assessment of soil functions. Multifunctionality can be achieved in agricultural soils; however, without specifically managing for it, biodiversity might come at a loss. Highlights We study how well soils can provide primary productivity, nutrient cycling and biodiversity. We study trade-offs and synergies among soil functions, as well as the drivers of these relationships.

Many marginal zones grazed for centuries are now suffering from abandonment, which has been found to be interrelated with species and functional diversity loss, and has potential consequences for the provision of ecosystem services such as soil fertility and soil carbon storage. We sampled soil and plant species abundance in a total of 64 plots (5 x 5 m), in wet and dry habitats under different grazing regimes (from moderate grazing to grazing abandonment for at least 30 years) in Central Spain. We tested the influence of grazing intensity and water availability on different variables related to soil fertility and also on soil carbon storage. In addition, Community weighted mean and Rao quadratic entropy were calculated for two effect traits (specific leaf area and plant height), in order to assess the ultimate effects of these functional attributes on multifunctionality (i.e., the provision of several simultaneous ecosystem functions). We found that grazing abandonment generally produces a reduction in soil organic matter, total nitrogen, available potassium and phosphorus, aggregate stability and soil carbon storage. In addition, grazing abandonment had a negative effect on soil texture with loss of fine particles (clay and silt) and water holding capacity, but only in dry habitats and in longer-term abandoned situation. In general, soil multifunctionality was higher in wet than dry habitats, decreased with grazing abandonment in both habitats. Soil multifunctionality was indirectly mediated by the functional structure of size and leaf traits of the local plant communities, but our results suggested that macroscale grazing effects, i.e. translocation of nutrients by grazers among habitats via dung and urine deposition, might be important mechanisms that influence soil multifunctionality at the local level.

While it is known that organic farming benefits biodiversity and ecosystem services, how organic farming affects their multifunctionality, including agronomical, ecological as well as economic dimensions, re-mains poorly explored.OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated how individual indicators regrouped into agroecosystem goods of vineyards respond to farming systems and landscape composition. We also explored how ecosystem services resulting from agroecosystem goods respond to farming systems and landscape composition. In addition, we evaluated trade-offs and synergies between agroecosystem goods as well as between ecosystem services for each farming systems. METHOD: We quantified 14 indicators corresponding to five agroecosystem goods (biodiversity conservation, soil organic matter decomposition, pest control, wine production, margin) in 20 pairs of organic and conven-tional vineyards.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Our study reveals that organic farming did not improve agroecosystem multi -functionality compared to conventional farming but led to lower trade-offs between agroecosystem goods. We found that organic systems increase supporting and regulating services but had lower provisioning service compared to conventional systems. Indeed, organic vineyards had multiple beneficial effects including higher pest control, lower production costs but produced less wine. Our results indicate a strong trade-off between pest control and wine production in both systems. In addition, conventional systems supported a negative trade-off between biodiversity conservation and wine production which was not the case of organic systems.SIGNIFICANCE: Our study provides key information to further design farming systems that combine ecological, economical and agronomical performances. Further investigations are now needed to identify which combined management options maximize multiple performance of agroecosystems independently of certifications and across scales.",###,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2022.103489,149,Jana,,No,No real diversity (plant and arthropod diversity is a part of multifunctionality),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is unclear how tree species functional composition influences species mixture effects on ecosystem multifunctionality. We selected 171 monospecific and mixed-species plantations from nine regions across subtropical China, and quantified 13 key ecosystem functional properties to investigate how species mixture effects on ecosystem multifunctionality are modulated by functional diversity and identity. We found that ecosystem multifunctionality was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in mixed tree plantations than in monospecific plantations except the mixed-conifer species plantations. Across all regions, ecosystem multifunctionality was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in mixed conifer-broadleaf plantations than in monospecific plantations of the corresponding species, but not different between mixed and monospecific coniferous plantations. The magnitude of species mixture effects on ecosystem multifunctionality varied greatly with tree species compositions. Taking Cunninghamia lanceolata Lamb. as an example, the effects varied from a range of 2.0%-9.6% when mixed with a conifer species to 36%-87% when mixed with a broadleaf species. The functional diversity was the dominate driver shaping ecosystem multifunctionality, while functional identity, as expressed by community-weighted mean of specific leaf area, also had a positive effect on ecosystem multifunctionality through the increased below-ground nitrogen and phosphorus stocks regulated by specific leaf area of the mixing tree species.

We found that ecosystem multifunctionality was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in mixed tree plantations than in monospecific plantations except the mixed-conifer species plantations. Across all regions, ecosystem multifunctionality was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in mixed conifer-broadleaf plantations than in monospecific plantations of the corresponding species, but not different between mixed and monospecific coniferous plantations. The magnitude of species mixture effects on ecosystem multifunctionality varied greatly with tree species compositions. Taking Cunninghamia lanceolata Lamb. as an example, the effects varied from a range of 2.0%-9.6% when mixed with a conifer species to 36%-87% when mixed with a broadleaf species. The functional diversity was the dominate driver shaping ecosystem multifunctionality, while functional identity, as expressed by community-weighted mean of specific leaf area, also had a positive effect on ecosystem multifunctionality through the increased below-ground nitrogen and phosphorus stocks regulated by specific leaf area of the mixing tree species.

Relatively little is known, however, of the actual environmental outcomes of this practice, termed 'farmscaping'. We inventoried communities of plant and soil organisms and monitored indicators of ecosystem functions in six distinct habitats of an organic farm in California's Central Valley to better understand the ecological costs and benefits of farmscaping. A riparian corridor, hedgerows, a system of drainage ditches, and tailwater ponds supported different plant life history/functional groups and greater native plant diversity than the two production fields. Differences were less pronounced for belowground organisms, i.e., nematode functional groups, microbial communities (based on phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis) and earthworm taxa. Partial ordination analysis showed that environmental variables, rather than spatial location, explained much of the distribution of soil and plant taxa across the farmscape. Riparian and hedgerow habitats with woody vegetation stored 18% of the farmscape's total carbon (C), despite occupying only 6% of the total area. Infiltration rates in the riparian corridor were >230% higher than those observed in the production fields, and concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in soil solution were as much as 65% higher. The tailwater pond reduced total suspended solids in irrigation runoff by 97%. Drainage ditches had the highest N2O-N emissions (mean values of 16.7 mu g m(-2) h(-1)) and nitrate (NO3--N) leaching (12.1 g m(-2) year(-1) at 75 cm depth). Emissions of N2O-N and leaching of NO3--N were, however, quite low for all the habitats. Non-production habitats increased biodiversity (particularly plants) and specific ecosystem functions (e.g. water regulation and carbon storage). Extrapolating relative tradeoffs to the entire farmscape showed that greater habitat enhancement through farmscaping could increase both biodiversity and multiple ecosystem functions of agricultural lands with minor loss of production area.

While multiple studies have demonstrated how landscape-scale strategies can minimise the trade-off between agricultural production and biodiversity conservation, little is known about which land-use strategies maximise the landscape-level supply of multiple ecosystem services (landscape multifunctionality), a common goal of stakeholder communities. We combine comprehensive data collected from 150 German grassland sites with a simulation approach to identify landscape compositions, with differing proportions of low-, medium-, and high-intensity grasslands, that minimise trade-offs between the six main grassland ecosystem services prioritised by local stakeholders: biodiversity conservation, aesthetic value, productivity, carbon storage, foraging, and regional identity. Results are made accessible through an online tool that provides information on which compositions best meet any combination of user-defined priorities (https://neyret.shinyapps.io/landscape_composition_for_multifunctionality/). Results show that an optimal landscape composition can be identified for any pattern of ecosystem service priorities. However, multifunctionality was similar and low for all landscape compositions in cases where there are strong trade-offs between services (e.g. aesthetic value and fodder production), where many services were prioritised, and where drivers other than land use played an important role. We also found that if moderate service levels are deemed acceptable, then strategies in which both high and low intensity grasslands are present can deliver landscape multifunctionality. The tool presented can aid informed decision-making by predicting the impact of future changes in landscape composition, and by allowing for the relative roles of stakeholder priorities and biophysical trade-offs to be understood by scientists and practitioners alike.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2021.101366,153,Jana,,No,No real diversity (plant diversity is a part of multifunctionality),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding the drivers of the ecosystem functions that support these services is therefore important. Much research has investigated how species richness influences functioning, but we lack knowledge of how other community attributes affect ecosystem functioning. Species evenness, species spatial arrangement, and the identity of dominant species are three attributes that could affect ecosystem functioning, by altering the relative abundance of functional traits and the probability of synergistic species interactions such as facilitation and complementary resource use. We tested the effect of these three community attributes and their interactions on ecosystem functions over a growing season, using model grassland communities consisting of three plant species from three functional groups: a grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), a forb (Plantago lanceolata), and a N-fixing forb (Lotus corniculatus). We measured multiple ecosystem functions that support ecosystem services, including ecosystem gas exchange, water retention, C and N loss in leachates, and plant biomass production. Species evenness and dominant species identity strongly influenced the ecosystem functions measured, but spatial arrangement had few effects. By the end of the growing season, evenness consistently enhanced ecosystem functioning and this effect occurred regardless of dominant species identity. The identity of the dominant species under which the highest level of functioning was attained varied across the growing season. Spatial arrangement had the weakest effect on functioning, but interacted with dominant species identity to affect some functions. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the role of multiple community attributes in driving ecosystem functioning.",2014,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-013-2814-5,154,Oksana,,No ,"No multifunctionality & No functions on higher trophic levels, modelling paper",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We quantified areas growing 'brighter' and 'darker' (i.e., better or worse than expected based on extrinsic constraints) for multifunctionality of ecosystem services (ES) over time across a dynamic agricultural landscape. To explore how areas changing in ES multifunctionality, we likewise explored temporal changes in additional features of resilience in social-ecological systems, including: (1) species functional richness and dispersion, (2) agrodiversity, (3) the diversity of farm characteristics and human demographics in the area, and (4) landscape structure and diversity. We found areas increasing in multi functionality were likewise becoming more biologically and agriculturally diverse, without large losses in overall food production. This suggests the potential for complementarity among goals of food production, multiple ES, and biological and agricultural diversity for agricultural landscapes.

Recent empirically based models using individual species' traits suggest that higher species richness is required to provide multiple ecosystem functions. However, no study to date has analyzed the observed functionality of communities of interacting species over multiple temporal scales to assess the relationship between biodiversity and multifunctionality. We use data from the longest-running biodiversity-functioning field experiment to date to test how species diversity affects the ability of grassland ecosystems to provide threshold levels of up to eight ecosystem functions simultaneously. Across years and every combination of ecosystem functions, minimum-required species richness consistently increases with the number of functions considered. Moreover, tradeoffs between functions and variability among years prevent any one community type from providing high levels of multiple functions, regardless of its diversity. Sustained multifunctionality, therefore, likely requires both higher species richness than single ecosystem functionality and a diversity of species assemblages across the landscape.",2010,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0906829107,156,Oksana,,Yes,NA,manipulative field experiment,Grassland species number manipulation,Biodiversity effects,Plant diversity,Plant community diversity,grassland plant diversity,Biodiversity (as management tool),Multifunctionality,Multifunctionality,Multifunctionality,multiple thresholds,"Includes: invasion resistance; above ground net primary productivity; below ground biomass; soil-nitrogen use (minimizing NO2+NO3,020 cm); insect species richness and abundance; soil C; and plant N (% N)",service,combined,"diversity, stocks, rates, soil properties","1,2,3, soil","AG, BG","herb, soil",NA,NA,Yes,plant species number,direct,direct,1,plants,plants,plants,plants,plants,plants,species,richness,richness,positive,P-value,Fig. 1,NA,NA,No,NA,NA,NA,No,NA,NA,No,NA,methodological,multifunctionality threshold,multifunctionality threshold,grasslands,grasslands,North America,USA,"USA (Minnesota, Cedar Creek)",,,No management tests
249,Crop functional diversity drives multiple ecosystem functions during early agroforestry succession,"dos Santos, D; Joner, F; Shipley, B; Teleginski, M; Lucas, RR; Siddique, I",J APPL ECOL,agroecological trade-offs; agroecosystem; ecological intensification; multifunctionality; plant traits; polycultures; syntropic agriculture,"We still lack practical guidelines for diversifying cropping systems that consider both yield and regulating functions of agroecosystems. Recent studies have suggested that maximizing functional diversity (FD, the distribution of species with different functional traits in the niche space) may lead to agroecosystems with greater multifunctionality due to niche complementarity. Therefore, scientists are now advocating the use of a trait-based approach to develop multifunctional sustainable agroecosystems. In order to assess the effects of crop FD on key agroecosystem functions and to consider trade-offs and synergies among them, we established, in late 2016, permanent experimental field plots of successional agroforestry systems (SAFS), in humid subtropical Southern Brazil. The experiment represents a gradient of plant functional trait diversity (designed FD based on leaf nitrogen concentration), while maintaining crop species richness constant across all treatments. Our hypothesis is that the observed FD of crops (hereafter, crop FD) drives multiple agroecosystem functions. We determined the observed FD by quantifying traits of crops and weeds (maximum plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area) and performed two data collections (March and September 2017) at the end of the summer and winter crops respectively. We used structural equation modelling to test a hypothetical causal model to explain how crop FD affects three functions: weed suppression, soil protection (soil cover by either crops or weeds) and crop yield. Our results support the hypothesis that high crop FD drives agroecosystem processes and contributes to the provision of multiple ecosystem functions. We found that with greater crop FD in SAFS, crop plants occupied a large niche space, thereby increasing the total photosynthetic light intercepted in the agroecosystem, that in turn, increased crop yield. Additionally, greater FD increased soil protection by crops and decreased weed cover. This greater FD also reduced the FD of the weed community. Synthesis and applications. Crop mixtures based on complementary plant traits can increase the multifunctionality of agroecosystems through their sustainable use. A more heterogeneous structure and projection of crop leaf area drives greater resistance to competition with weeds and produces higher crop yields in young diversified crop mixtures.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13930,157,Oksana,,No ,No multifunctionality & No functions on higher trophic levels,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, how soil moisture condition, plant species richness interactively affect ecosystem functions in shrub-encroached grasslands is poorly understood. We conducted a soil moisture x species richness microcosm experiment using semi-arid grassland species with a N-fixing shrub Caragana microphylla Lam. as the dominant species to evaluate how soil moisture and plant species richness affected ecosystem functions directly or indirectly via regulating community functional structure, such as community weighted mean values (CWM) and functional dispersion (FDis). Soil moisture and species richness interactively affected soil functions (soil C-, N-, P cycles and soil multifunctionality), with greater species richness buffering the adverse effects of soil drought. Soil moisture and species richness showed opposite effects on FDis but similar effects on CWM. FDis mediated the indirect effect of soil moisture and species richness on ecosystem functions, while CWM only mediated the indirect effect of soil moisture. More specifically, both soil moisture and plant species richness were negatively associated with soil P cycle, and the CWMPC1 contributed by traits related to resource-conservative strategy was positively associated with soil N cycle. Species richness showed a positive direct effect on total shoot biomass, which was mainly contributed by the complementarity effect of neighbor species richness. This study provides strong empirical support of how biomass and soil nutrient cycles respond to the changes of soil moisture and plant species richness in C. microphylla shrub-encroached grasslands, and insights on the mechanisms underlying the interactive effects of soil condition and community species composition on multiple ecosystem functions in N-fixing shrub encroached grasslands in semi-arid grassland regions.

Integration strategies and management guidelines are needed to optimize production of these new crops, which differ substantially from both annual grain crops and perennial forages. To offset relatively low grain yields, perennial grain cropping systems should be multifunctional. Growing perennial grains for several years to regenerate soil health before rotating to annual crops and growing perennial grains on sloped land and ecologically sensitive areas to reduce soil erosion and nutrient losses are two strategies that can provide ecosystem services and support multifunctionality. Several perennial cereals can be used to produce both grain and forage, and these dual-purpose crops can be intercropped with legumes for additional benefits.

Studying the relationship between multiple biodiversity (MBD) across trophic levels and ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) is becoming a frontier in ecosystem science. Here, by synthesizing the impacts of grazing on MBD and EMF in drylands, we found that the response of MBD depends on the interactions of grazing intensity, livestock type and aridity. MBD responds to grazing intensity following a unimodal pattern in the relatively humid areas, but a negatively linear response in the dry areas. Moreover, the MBD mediates the response of EMF to grazing. Therefore, we suggest a sustainable grassland management considering grazing practices and local climate to maintain a high-level of EMF and MBD conservation in drylands.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2020.09.005,161,Oksana,,No ,Literature review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cover crop mixtures with complementary plant functional traits including biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) may supply nitrogen (N) to farm fields while simultaneously providing other ecosystem functions such as N retention and weed suppression (i.e., multifunctionality). Understanding variation in these relationships across farms can help advance trait-based research in agroecology and ecological approaches to nutrient management. 2. This on-farm experiment explored the contributions of two-and three-species cover crop mixtures, which combined legumes, brassicas and cool season grasses, to ecosystem functions across a gradient of soil fertility levels driven by farm management history. 3. I evaluated the predictions that functional trait diversity of the cover crops would explain variation in multifunctionality, and that legume biomass and BNF within mixtures would be inversely correlated with indicators of soil N availability from organic matter across the farm gradient. 4. Ecosystem functions varied widely across farms. As expected, functional diversity was a significant predictor of multifunctionality, although the relationship was weak. Cover crop mixtures had significantly greater multifunctionality than a cereal rye monoculture, though not at the highest observed levels of each function, indicating trade-offs among functions. Linear regression models showed that legume biomass and BNF were negatively correlated with soil properties indicative of N availability from soil organic matter, whereas non-legume and weed biomass were positively correlated with other measures of soil fertility. 5. Synthesis and applications. Cover crop mixtures can increase functional diversity within crop rotations. Designing mixtures with complementary plant traits may be particularly effective for increasing multifunctionality and agroecosystem sustainability.

However, less is known about the permanence and reversibility of these responses. To gain insight into whether multifunctionality can be sustained under intensive management, we developed a framework building on the concept of resilience: a system's ability to avoid displacement and to return or transform to a desired state. We applied it to test the ability of forest multifunctionality to persist during and recover from intensive management for timber production in a boreal forest. Using forest growth simulations and multiobjective optimization, we created alternative future paths where the forest was managed for maximal timber production, for forest multifunctionality, or first maximal timber production and then multifunctionality. We show that forest multifunctionality is substantially diminished under intensive forestry and recovers the slower, the longer intensive forestry has been continued. Intensive forestry thus not only reduces forest multifunctionality but hinders its recovery should management goals change, i.e., weakens its resilience.

Although individual ecosystem functions have been extensively investigated in the vegetation fragmentation and grassland degradation processes, the multiple ecosystem functions are rarely evaluated. Moreover, little is known on how species richness and functional compositions are associated with individual functions, and how such functions contribute to multifunctionality during vegetation fragmentation. In this study, 14 interconnected functions were derived from the seven fragmentation intensities of grassland on the Tibetan Plateau. According to vegetation continuity, three communities (an ungrazed grasses and Kobresia humilis community, a lightly-grazed Kobresia humilis and K. pygmaea community, and a medium-grazed K. pygmaea community) were treated as the pre-patchiness stage, and four communities (a heavily-grazed cracked K. pygmaea community, an eroded K. pygmaea community, a severely eroded K. pygmaea community, and a bare black-soil crust) were treated as the vegetation patchiness stage. Multivariate diversity interaction framework was used to test the effects of species richness and functional composition on multiple ecosystem functions. Desired multifunctionality was assessed based on three relatively independent functions: aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage. The threshold was identified to signify the rapid decline of the multifunctionality. Our results showed that positive effects of species richness were observed among most of the functions in pre-patchiness communities. Such effects disappeared in vegetation patchiness communities. Shifts in functional composition explained the large variations in most of the functions in the two stages. Furthermore, a trade-off in abundance between grasses and sedges contributed to the negative correlation between the aboveground and belowground biomass in the pre-patchiness stage. Consistent decreases in the abundance of functional groups led to a rapid decline of the individual functions, and, as a consequence, an abrupt decline in the multifunctionality. Our results demonstrated that managing grassland for ecosystem multifunctionality and species conservation requires a detailed understanding of the effects of the various drivers, including species richness, functional composition, grazing intensity, and climate conditions.",2020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106095,165,Oksana,,Yes,NA,field observation,Fragmentation intensity,Land use intensity,Management intensity,Fragmentation,fragmentation intensity,NA,Multifunctionality,Multifunctionality,Multifunctionality,averaging,"Includes:  aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, and soil organic carbon pool.",service,combined,"stocks, soil properties","1, soil","AG, BG","herb, soil",negative,patchiness of grassland vegetation,No,NA,indirect,via land use,1,plants,plants,plants,plants,plants,plants,species,richness,richness,positive,P-value,Fig. 4,NA,NA,No,NA,NA,NA,No,NA,NA,No,NA,land use factors,land use,"fragmentation intensity, patchiness of grassland vegetation",grasslands,alpine grasslands (summer grazing pastures),Asia,China,China (Qinghai province),"Haibei (37.80 N, 100.48 E), Huangnan (35.01 N, 101.54 E), and Guoluo (34.46 N, 10025 E)","Haibei (37.80 N, 100.48 E), Huangnan (35.01 N, 101.54 E), and Guoluo (34.46 N, 10025 E)",No management tests

Mercury (Hg) is a heavy metal that is toxic to microorganisms, but its effects on microbial community assembly and ecosystem multifunctionality in rice paddy ecosystems remain largely unknown. In the current study, we analyzed the microbial community structure and ecosystem multifunctionality of paddy soils across a Hg contamination gradient. The results demonstrated that Hg contamination significantly altered the microbial community structure. The microbial communities were predominantly driven by deterministic selection rather than stochastic processes. The random forest model and variation partition analysis demonstrated that the Hg level was the most important predictor of microbial profiles. Ecosystem multifunctionality decreased across the Hg concentration gradient, and multifunctionality was significantly correlated with soil biodiversity, suggesting that Hg-induced reductions in soil biodiversity led to reduced ecosystem services. A structural equation model showed that Hg contamination directly and indirectly affected ecosystem multifunctionality. The present work broadens our knowledge of the assembly of the microbiome in rice paddies across a Hg contamination gradient and highlights the significance of soil biodiversity in regulating ecosystem functions, especially in Hg-polluted rice paddies.",2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.129055,167,Oksana,,No ,Effects of hazardous pollution (Hg contamination) from industry and not related to land use,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We propose that adaptive management is the most suitable management approach for such goals, given its ability to reduce uncertainty over time and support multiple objectives within a system, for multiple actors. As such, adaptive management may be the most appropriate method for sustainably intensifying production whilst increasing the quantity and quality of ecosystem services. However, the current assessment of performance of agricultural systems doesn't reward ecosystem service provision. Therefore, we present an overview of the ecosystem functions agricultural systems should and could provide, coupled with a revised definition for assessing the performance of agricultural systems from a multifunctional perspective that, when all satisfied; would create adaptive agricultural systems that can increase production whilst ensuring food security and the quantity and quality of ecosystem services. The outcome of this high level of performance is the capacity to respond to multiple shocks without collapse, equity and triple bottom line sustainability. Through the assessment of case studies, we find that alternatives to industrialized agricultural systems incorporate more functional goals, but that there are mixed findings as to whether these goals translate into positive measurable outcomes. We suggest that an adaptive management perspective would support the implementation of a systematic analysis of the social, ecological and economic trade-offs occurring within such systems, particularly between ecosystem services and functions, in order to provide suitable and comparable assessments. We also identify indicators to monitor performance at multiple scales in agricultural systems which can be used within an adaptive management framework to increase resilience at multiple scales.

Due to reduction in grass (forage), woody encroachment is viewed as ecosystem disservice and degradation, even though this may not reduce ecosystem functions. Often, management perceptions of degradation remain inadequately informed by knowledge of ecosystem processes. We compared 11 biotic variables related to soil and microbial functions under shrubs against paired-adjacent grassland:-carbon, nitrogen, C:N ratio, organic matter, plant-available N, N-mineralization rate, microbial biomass C and N, basal respiration, and metabolic-quotient. We summarized these as a multifunction-index. We also measured five soil physico-chemical covariates:-pH, conductivity, bulk density, texture and water holding capacity. These 11 biotic variables were 15-48% higher under shrubs than under grass; multifunction-index was also higher (by 366%). After accounting for spatial autocorrelation and background differences in physico-chemical covariates (redundancy analysis), altered ecosystem functions were attributable to shrubs. Overall, shrubs can enhance ecosystem functions, and maintain important ecological processes through concomitant changes in soil physico-chemical properties. While shrubs should not be equated to ecological degradation, they present a challenging triage of ecosystem service, disservice, and function for grasslands.

Understanding the effects of grazing intensity, aridity, and soil microbes is required for sustainable management. Here, we focused on arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in soils and roots and examined their relationship with ecosystem multifunctionality under livestock grazing of Mongolian grasslands with different aridity levels. Above-and below-ground plant biomass were used to measure ecosystem-service multifunctionality, excluding annual plants that are unfavorable for ecosystem function and rangeland management.

Overall, crop diversity showed a relatively minor effect on soil microbial diversity, SMF and yields. In contrast, the proportion of time with crop cover (including cash crops, cover crops or forage leys) during the past ten-year crop rotation had a much stronger impact. This suggests that increasing crop cover can enhance both yields and soil functioning, while also providing habitat for soil microorganisms. We found that SMF did not positively contribute to crop yields, highlighting that care must be taken to balance the provision of food with environmentally beneficial functions and services, since they do not always go hand in hand.

However, the impact of agricultural management history on soil multifunctionality and its relationship with soil microbial diversity has not been well understood enough. To address this gap, we characterized the multifunctionality (via activity of multiple extracellular enzymes) in soils subjected to four rice rotation regimes (rice-rapeseed, rice-wheat, rice-vegetable and rice-fallow) with or without fertilization and explored the linkages between bacterial community diversity and soil multifunctionality. We found that the crop rotation history rather than fertilization explained a significant portion of the variation in soil multifunctionality (52%), bacterial species richness (69%) and community composition (61%). Bacterial diversity (species richness and weighted Unifrac dissimilarity) exhibited strong positive relationships with soil multifunctionality. In particular, bacterial diversity in the rice-rapeseed rotation had the strongest effect on the ability of the soil system to provide more functions. Partial least squares path modeling indicated that crop rotation indirectly controlled soil multifunctionality via changes in bacterial species richness and community composition, which positively affected multifunctionality mainly by regulating C cycling-related enzyme activities. This study highlights the importance of the crop rotation history in influencing soil microbial diversity and multifunctionality relationships, indicating rice rotation with rapeseed combined with fertilization can greatly improve soil multifunctionality despite the typical focus on nutrient inputs in cropland ecosystems.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2021.107550,173,Oksana,,Yes,NA,field observation,Fertilization (with and without fertilizer inputs),Land use intensity,Fertilization,Fertilization,conventional,NA,Multifunctionality,Multifunctionality,Multifunctionality,"averaging, multiple thresholds",Includes:  activity of multiple extracellular enzymes,service,soil properties,soil properties,soil,BG,soil,negative,"rotation species (rice-rapeseed, rice-wheat, rice-vegetable and rice-fallow)",No,NA,indirect,via land use,"2,3",consumers,consumers,bacteria,microorganisms,bacteria,soil bacteria,species,richness,richness,positive,P-value,Fig. 3,neutral,"rotation species (rice-rapeseed, rice-wheat, rice-vegetable and rice-fallow)",No,NA,NA,NA,No,NA,NA,No,NA,biotic properties of study system,plant taxa,"rotation species (rice-rapeseed, rice-wheat, rice-vegetable and rice-fallow), multifunctionality threshold",croplands,rice croplands,Asia,China,China (Hubei Province),30435 N,1121825 E,

Agriculture's influence on humanity is a dichotomy of promise and peril. Research on the food-environment dilemma has highlighted the environmental consequences of food production, yet the identification of management solutions is an ongoing challenge. 2. We suggest bright spots as a promising tool to identify levers of change by finding areas that exceed expectations for goals, such as agricultural landscape multifunctionality and biodiversity. 3. We identified bright, dark and average spots within a complex agricultural landscape and explored the associated socioeconomic patterns. We found that areas exceeding expectations for biodiversity and landscape multifunctionality were neither spatially congruent nor in conflict. It was more common for areas to underperform (dark spots) for both biodiversity and multifunctionality than over perform for both (bright spots). 4. While dark spots for multifunctionality were alike in their ecosystem service composition, bright spots were bright in multiple, diverse ways. The socioeconomic attributes that characterize bright and darks spots included both farm characteristics as well as farming practices, suggesting that both have potential to be levers of change. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that while biodiversity and landscape multifunctionality show similar spatial patterns due to underlying biophysical drivers, managing for biodiversity or landscape multifunctionality alone will not implicitly achieve the other in this system. Bright spots (areas exceeding expectations) in multifunctionality were associated with many different combinations of ecosystem services, but dark spots were uniquely agricultural intensive areas devoted to maximizing crop production at the expense of all other services. From a management perspective, specific farm characteristics and farming practices may impact the potential for multifunctionality: increased mechanization, increased agricultural inputs and larger farm size and capital were associated with dark spots, while smaller farms with potentially greater space for innovation were associated with bright spots.",2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13191,174,Oksana,,No ,Socio-ecological study,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As such, alternative management regimes have emerged, aspiring to promote forest biodiversity and nature protection in managed forests. Among them, continuous cover forestry, (i.e. selective logging), has received considerable attention and is being promoted by some researchers and NGOs. Yet, the full consequences of banning clear-cuts (i.e. rotation forestry) and replacing it entirely with continuous cover forest remains uncertain. We explore how restricting forest management alternatives (either rotation forestry or continuous cover forestry) will affect landscape-scale forest multifunctionality at a range of harvesting levels. We evaluate multifunctionality as a combination of recreational ecosystem services, climate change mitigation, habitat availability for vertebrates, and red-listed dead wood dependent species. Our results show that restricting forest management alternatives have a negative impact on forest multifunctionality at all harvesting levels when compared to the case with no restrictions. Using only continuous cover forestry management alternatives resulted in higher multifunctionality than the case when only rotation forestry management alternatives were used. We also show that maximizing multifunctionality using all management alternatives led to high proportion of continuous cover forestry over the landscape. We conclude that banning clear-cuts does not promote forest biodiversity and multifunctionality at the landscape scale, especially if there is a requirement for high economic benefits from the forest. However, we recommend that continuous cover forestry should be considered as a primary management alternative, with selective application of rotation forestry wisely planned at the landscape scale.",2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.104918,175,Oksana,,No ,No biodiversity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quantifying the succession sequence and assessing the dynamics of plant composition, ecosystem coupling, and multifunctionality across successional stages are essential for reasonable restoration of degraded alpine meadow. Here, we selected areas with different grazing disturbance histories and used them as a space series (i.e., space-for-time substitution) to study the community succession. Our work quantified the plant succession sequence of alpine meadow induced by grazing with plant functional group approach. The plant succession sequence is from the tall sedge community with erect growth to the short undesirable toxic forbs community with prostrate growth. Ecosystem coupling, ecosystem multifunctionality and their relationships were all the lowest in Stage 4. Compared to Stage 4, the ecosystem multifunctionality index increased in Stages 1, 2, and 3 by 102.6, 89.8, and 207.6%, respectively; the extent of ecosystem coupling increased by 20.0, 16.8, and 21.2%, respectively. Our results indicated that the driving factors of ecosystem coupling and ecosystem multifunctionality were soil factor individual in early successional stage to plant-soil simultaneously in late successional stage. Our results also highlighted the importance of toxic weeds during the late stage of degraded succession and suggest that the expansion of toxic plants is a consequence of their greater suitability from a successional perspective.

Four Swedish rural communities were examined to increase our understanding of the functions that a diverse agriculture provides and which of these are lost as farms cease operation and overall rural social capital is depleted. Workshops and interviews with village action groups and with farmers were carried out. Both groups identified key functions from farming that are important to the rural community, such as production of food and fiber, businesses and jobs, human services, local security, ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling and biodiversity, and functions pertaining to quality of life. Several ways in which village action groups can support agriculture were identified that current industrial agriculture and even agri-environmental schemes fail to achieve. These include organizing local meeting places, encouraging local processing and consumption and supporting farmers in their work.

However, we know little about the consequences of soil acidification for a wide range of ecosystem functions and services (i.e. ecosystem multifunctionality). Here, we examined the impacts of short-term soil acidification on 19 ecosystem functions relevant to ecosystem primary productivity and the cycling and/or storage of soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) using a 2-year acid addition field experiment in a semi-arid grassland on the Loess Plateau, China. We further assessed the potential pathways through which plant diversity and soil processes drive ecosystem multifunctionality (hereafter, EMF, EMF-productivity, EMF-C, EMF-N, EMF-P). We found that soil acidification suppressed 15 of the 19 individual ecosystem functions. By accounting for other biotic and abiotic confounding variables, we found that soil pH remains to be the dominant one explaining the variation in EMF, EMF-C and EMF-N. The underlying mechanisms of soil pH driving multifunctionality varied substantially among the groups of multifunctionality. Specifically, plant-related variables (i.e. species richness and abundance) exhibited stronger mediating effects on EMF-productivity and EMF-C than did soil properties (i.e. soil K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and Na+ ions) and microbial-related variables (i.e. microbial biomass C and N). Our findings provide empirical evidence that short-term soil acidification could have greater negative effects on ecosystem multifunctionality than expected in the arid and semi-arid areas where alkaline soils are commonly seen. This study also indicates that more attention should be paid to the biological mechanisms mediating multifunctional ecosystems under a global change scenario in the future.

However, few studies have examined how grazing intensity affects ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) via its effects on plant diversity and soil microbial diversity in dry grasslands. We conducted a 12-year experiment manipulating sheep grazing intensity in a desert steppe of northern China. Through measuring plant species diversity, soil microbial diversity (bacteria diversity) and multiple ecosystem functions (i.e., aboveground net primary productivity, belowground biomass of plant community, temporal stability of ANPP, soil organic matter, moisture, available nitrogen and phosphorus, ecosystem respiration and gross ecosystem productivity), we aimed to understand how grazing intensity affected EMF via changing the diversity of plants and microbes. Our results showed that increasing grazing intensity significantly reduced EMF and most individual ecosystem functions, as well as the diversity of plants and microbes, while EMF and most individual functions were positively related to plant diversity and soil microbial diversity under all grazing intensities. In particular, soil microbial diversity in shallow soil layers (0-5 cm depth) had stronger positive correlations with plant diversity and EMF than in deeper soil layers. Furthermore, structural equation modeling (SEM) showed that grazing reduced EMF mainly via reducing plant diversity, rather than by reducing soil microbial diversity. Thus, plant diversity played a more important role in mediating the response of EMF to grazing disturbance. This study highlights the critical role of aboveand belowground diversity in mediating the response of EMF to grazing intensity, which has important implications for biodiversity conservation and sustainability in arid grasslands.

The advent of affordable DNA metabarcoding approaches greatly facilitates quantitative understanding of trophic networks and their response to environmental drivers. Here, we examine how key environmental gradients interact to shape predation by Lycosidae in highly dynamic vegetable growing systems in China. RESULTS For the sampled Lycosidae, crop identity, pesticide use and seasons shape the abundance of prey detected in spider guts. For the taxonomic richness of prey, local- and landscape-scale factors gradients were more influential. Multivariate ordinations confirm that these crop-abundant spiders dynamically adjust their diet to reflect environmental constraints and seasonal availability to prey. CONCLUSION Plasticity in diet composition is likely to account for the persistence of spiders in relatively ephemeral brassica crops. Our findings provide further insights into the optimization of habitat management for predator-based biological control practices.

We compared soil bacterial and fungal communities, soil abiotic properties, and soil nitrogen (N) function and multifunctionality in the afforested sites that were previously grassland, on a subtropical plateau in China. We also explored the degree to which the niche complementarity effect and the selection effect of microbes are linked to soil N function and multifunctionality.

We investigated plant species diversity effects on individual functions and overall multifunctionality in a grassland experiment with sown monocultures and mixtures comprising four key grass and legume species. Nitrogen fertilisation rates were 50, 150, and 450 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (N50, N150, N450). Ten functions were measured representing forage production, N cycling, and forage quality, all being related to either productivity or environmental footprint. Multifunctionality was analysed by a novel approach using the mean log response ratio across functions. Over three experimental years, mixture effects benefited all forage production and N cycling functions, while sustaining high forage quality. Thus, mixture effects did not provoke any trade-off among the analysed functions. High N fertilisation rates generally diminished mixture benefits. Multifunctionality of four-species mixtures was considerably enhanced, and mixture overall performance was up to 1.9 (N50), 1.8 (N150), and 1.6 times (N450) higher than in averaged monocultures. Multifunctionality of four-species mixtures at N50 was at least as high as in grass monocultures at N450.

We found that there were contrasting patterns of low and high EMF in the alpine grassland ecosystem on the Tibetan Plateau. Specifically, compared with low EMF, environmental factors showed higher sensitivity to high EMF. Soil properties are critical factors that mediate the impact of community functions on low EMF based on the change of partial correlation coefficients from 0 to 0.24.

Considering it as a locally, socially-constructed concept, the objective of this paper is to analyse how the idea of agricultural multifunctionality was appropriated, re-constructed and negotiated in local arenas dedicated to land-use management. Conceptually, we adopt a political ecology approach which uses a constructivist and relational approach to the concept of 'ecosystem services'. Drawing on a case study in the French Pyrenees mountains, we analyse the diversity of discourses on the roles of livestock fanning held by local stakeholders and unpack the ways that these different discourses interact with each other in the local action arenas. We show that a coalition of interests led to the emergence of a dominant and apparent consensus around the need to support livestock farming to maintain open landscapes. We also show that behind this apparent consensus, there are in fact tensions between people who want to maintain livestock farming for different reasons, with some having more instrumental visions than others. Finally, we demonstrate that the dominant consensus has generated a local taboo, hiding an unvoiced pro-rewilding perspective which considers that farmland abandonment could be an opportunity in terms of biodiversity. Incorporating the two concepts of ecosystem services and agricultural multifunctionality, this study allows us to discuss their respective heuristic values and policy implications.",###,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2019.11.012,186,Jana,,No,"no diversity, interviews only",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about interconnections between EMF and taxonomic and phylogenetic diversities of rare and abundant bacteria. Using MiSeq sequencing and multiple statistical analyses, we evaluated the maintenance of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversities of rare and abundant bacteria and their contributions to EMF in salinized agricultural soils (0.09 to 19.91 dS/m). Rare bacteria exhibited closer phylogenetic clustering and broader environmental breadths than abundant ones, while abundant bacteria showed higher functional redundancies and stronger phylogenetic signals of ecological preferences than rare ones. Variable selection (86.7%) dominated rare bacterial community assembly, and dispersal limitation (54.7%) and variable selection (24.5%) determined abundant bacterial community assembly. Salinity played a decisive role in mediating the balance between stochastic and deterministic processes and showed significant effects on functions and diversities of both rare and abundant bacteria. Rare bacterial taxonomic alpha-diversity and abundant bacterial phylogenetic alpha-diversity contributed significantly to EMF, while abundant bacterial taxonomic alpha-diversity and rare bacterial phylogenetic alpha-diversity did not. Additionally, abundant rather than rare bacterial community function had a significant effect on soil EMF. These findings extend our knowledge of environmental adaptation of rare and abundant bacteria and highlight different contributions of taxonomic and phylogenetic alpha-diversities of rare and abundant bacteria to soil EMF. IMPORTANCE Soil salinization is a worldwide environmental problem and threatens plant productivity and microbial diversity. Understanding the generation and maintenance of microbial diversity is essential to estimate soil tillage potential via investigating ecosystem multifunctionality.

294,Bridging Rare and Abundant Bacteria with Ecosystem Multifunctionality in Salinized Agricultural Soils: from Community Diversity to Environmental Adaptation,"Wan, WJ; Liu, S; Li, X; Xing, YH; Chen, WL; Huang, QY",MSYSTEMS,bacterial diversity; environmental breadth; phylogenetic signal; phylogenetic clustering; salinity; stochastic versus deterministic,"Bacterial diversity and ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) vary along environmental gradients. However, little is known about interconnections between EMF and taxonomic and phylogenetic diversities of rare and abundant bacteria. Using MiSeq sequencing and multiple statistical analyses, we evaluated the maintenance of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversities of rare and abundant bacteria and their contributions to EMF in salinized agricultural soils (0.09 to 19.91 dS/m). Rare bacteria exhibited closer phylogenetic clustering and broader environmental breadths than abundant ones, while abundant bacteria showed higher functional redundancies and stronger phylogenetic signals of ecological preferences than rare ones. Variable selection (86.7%) dominated rare bacterial community assembly, and dispersal limitation (54.7%) and variable selection (24.5%) determined abundant bacterial community assembly. Salinity played a decisive role in mediating the balance between stochastic and deterministic processes and showed significant effects on functions and diversities of both rare and abundant bacteria. Rare bacterial taxonomic alpha-diversity and abundant bacterial phylogenetic alpha-diversity contributed significantly to EMF, while abundant bacterial taxonomic alpha-diversity and rare bacterial phylogenetic alpha-diversity did not. Additionally, abundant rather than rare bacterial community function had a significant effect on soil EMF. These findings extend our knowledge of environmental adaptation of rare and abundant bacteria and highlight different contributions of taxonomic and phylogenetic alpha-diversities of rare and abundant bacteria to soil EMF. IMPORTANCE Soil salinization is a worldwide environmental problem and threatens plant productivity and microbial diversity. Understanding the generation and maintenance of microbial diversity is essential to estimate soil tillage potential via investigating ecosystem multifunctionality.

However, research on how the agricultural multifunctionality is being temporally adjusted under the process of rapid urbanization remains limited. Here, we use the Yangtze River Delta, one of the newest metropolitan agglomerations globally, as study area to investigate the threats of modern urbanization to traditional agriculture. This study assessed changes to farmland area and the agricultural multifunctionality of 16 cities in the delta during 1995-2015. The results show that: (1) 87.1% (690,200 hm(2)) of farmland area was lost because of urban sprawl over the last 20 years; (2) the total value of agricultural multifunctionality in the delta had increased by 23.2%, which was mainly attributed to a significant increase in food provision and cultural leisure values; (3) the key factor affecting the spatial differentiation of agricultural multifunctionality changed from agricultural labour in 1995 to gross domestic product in 2005 and 2015; and (4) Socio-economic conditions and natural resources determined the adaptive change model of agricultural multifunctionality in different groups of cities. These results illustrate that agricultural multifunctionality is being adjusted to rapid urbanization through the intensification and trade-off of the multiple functions in agricultural system. Therefore, to foster the sustainable development of agriculture in metropolitan agglomerations, future land use policy should focus on both urban control and promoting agricultural multifunctionality. Ongoing transformation practices, such as land consolidation, should aim to improve the bio-physical and socio-economic functions of farmland in the delta. Future research should focus on developing locally suitable strategies based on the adaptive mechanisms of agricultural multifunctionality under changing environments in different cities.

These changes have led to a variety of negative environmental effects and influence ecosystem services. We present a novel small-scale and site-specific cropping system which splits a large field into small homogeneous sub-fields called 'patches' grouped in different yield potentials. A detailed workflow is presented to generate new spatially arranged patches with special focus on preprocessing and filtering of multi-year yield data, the variation in patch sizes and the adaptation of maximum working width to use available conventional farm equipment and permanent traffic lanes. The reduction of variance by the used cluster algorithm depends on the within-field heterogeneity. The patch size, the number of growing seasons (GS) used for clustering and the parallel shift of the patch structure along the permanent traffic lane resulted in a change in relative variance. Independent cross validation showed an increased performance of the classification algorithm with increasing number of GS used for clustering. The applied cluster analysis resulted in robust field segregation according to different yield potential zones and provides an innovative method for a novel cropping system.",###,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2022.106894,189,Jana,,No,no diversity (precision farming),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, because of the trade-offs between multiple ESs and the conflicts between different stakeholders, the sustainable management of plantations has been exceedingly challenging. Especially in recent years, with China's emphasis on ecological civilization construction and sustainable development, forestry departments have begun to focus on long-term ecological benefits, which conflict with farmers' attention to short-term economic gains. In this study, we quantified 15 field-based ES indicators from the data measured in Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantations aged 4 to 32 years. Corresponding to the concerns of two different stakeholders (forestry departments and farmers), we calculated ESmultifunctionality with different thresholds under four management scenarios: equal weight, production only, production multifunctionality, and supporting multifunctionality. Our results suggested pronounced stand age effects on both individual ESs and ES-multifunctionality of plantations. For individual ESs, stand age had a greater impact on provisioning services than on supporting services. High degree of trade-offs existed between plantation provisioning ESs and soil nutrient supporting ESs, and between water relevant ESs and the other ESs. With respect to ES-multifunctionality, the values under different scenarios were all augmented with stand age, but to differing degrees. The values for supporting multifunctionality were higher than those of production multifunctionality and production only before 21 years of stand development, but completely reversed once the fir plantations reached an age of 25 years. Finally, several stage-based plantation management recommendations are proposed to minimize conflicts between different stakeholders.

298,A comprehensive spatially-explicit analysis of agricultural landscape multifunctionality using a New Zealand hill country farm case study,"Tran, DX; Pearson, D; Palmer, A; Gray, D; Lowry, J; Dominati, EJ",AGR SYST,Spatial analysis; Ecosystem services; Agricultural intensification; Landscape planning; Land use land cover; Sustainable agriculture,"CONTEXT: Multifunctionality can refer to the capacity of a landscape to provide a wide range of ecosystem services (ES). Maintaining or restoring multifunctionality in agricultural landscapes is considered an efficient solution to achieve sustainable agricultural production because multiple ES provided by a landscape can support both environmental protection and socio-economic benefits. Quantifying the provision of ES provides funda-mental information to measure landscape multifunctionality and inform sustainable land management strategies. Although a large number of studies have been carried out to measure landscape multifunctionality and associated ES, comprehensive spatially explicit assessments at the farm scale are limited.OBJECTIVE: This research applies a wide range of spatial models, tools, and methods to spatially quantify the provision of multiple ES as well as the pattern of landscape multifunctionality in farmed landscapes. METHODS: To quantify the provision of multiple ES provided by the landscape, the bio-physical models provided by InVEST (e.g., Nutrient Delivery Ratio and Sediment Delivery Ratio models) and land use land cover-based assessments using spatial analysis tools in ArcGIS were employed. The Analytic Hierarchy Process was applied to calculate the landscape multifunctionality index which is an integration of multiple ES supply. Hot spot analysis using Getis Ord Gi* statistics was utilised to examine the spatial distribution of multiple ecosystem services. A hill country farm in New Zealand is chosen as a case study because it is a good example of a diverse landscape that is facing significant environmental issues due to intensive agricultural production.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals that the provision of ES and the pattern of landscape multi -functionality is highly variable across the farm. Both positive and negative relationships among ES are found and the interactions between them are mainly reflected in three ES bundles: the agricultural land, the indigenous forest and wetlands, and the mixed land uses. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that the quality of landscape is significantly dependent on the landscape management goals and preferences of the farmer so involving them into the process of ES and landscape multifunctionality assessment at a farm scale is essential step to obtain more comprehensive results. SIGNIFICANCE: Results from this study enable important questions to be answered regarding the spatial variation of ES provision and how land use and land management goals relate to the value and quality of landscape multifunctionality. This can provide valuable information to design future multifunctional landscapes and inform decision making in relation to sustainable land use management.",###,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2022.103494,191,Jana,,No,"no diversity, just GIS study",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is still unclear how organic management performs over time and whether the duration of organic management influences crop yield and ecosystem functioning. Here we compared 34 fields in Swiss farms assigned to four groups: 1) conventionally managed farms; 2) farms in transition to organic farming (in the 1st - 3rd year); 3) farms converted moderately long ago (9-13 years); and 4) farms subjected to long-term organic farming (15-32 years). We selected one field per farm and examined in two subsequent years whether management practices (conventional vs. organic farming) and the duration of organic management affected crop yield, weed cover, soil fertility and biodiversity as well as the overall system performance, assessed as ecosystem multifunctionality. Maize yield (-6.0%) and wheat yield (-22.2%) decreased in organic compared to conventional fields. However, the duration of organic management did not affect crop yield. There was also no effect of the duration of organic management on weed cover but it was much higher under organic management, with mean values of 33.0% in organic compared to 2.0% in conventional fields in maize, and 13.4% compared to 1.2% in wheat, respectively.

306,Plant Diversity and Fungal Richness Regulate the Changes in Soil Multifunctionality in a Semi-Arid Grassland,"Li, Z; Liu, XW; Zhang, MH; Xing, F",BIOLOGY-BASEL,plant diversity loss; soil multifunctionality; fungal diversity; saprotrophic fungi; rare microbial taxa,"Simple Summary Understanding relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functions is important in the context of global plant diversity loss. We evaluated the relationships between soil bacterial and fungal diversity, rare microbial taxa, and soil multifunctionality in a semi-arid grassland with varied plant diversity levels. The fungal richness rather than bacterial richness was positively related to soil multifunctionality. The relative abundance of saprotrophs was positively correlated with soil multifunctionality, and the relative abundance of pathogens was negatively correlated with soil multifunctionality. Furthermore, the rare fungal taxa played a disproportionate role in regulating soil multifunctionality. The shift of plant biomass allocation patterns increased plant below-ground biomass in the high diversity plant assemblages, which can alleviate soil microbial carbon limitations and enhance the fungal richness, thus promoting soil multifunctionality. This study provides a new perspective for evaluating the relative roles of fungal and bacterial diversity in maintaining multiple soil functions under global plant diversity loss scenarios. Loss in plant diversity is expected to impact biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) in terrestrial ecosystems. Soil microbes play essential roles in regulating ecosystem functions. However, the important roles and differences in bacterial and fungal diversity and rare microbial taxa in driving soil multifunctionality based on plant diversity remain poorly understood in grassland ecosystems. Here, we carried out an experiment in six study sites with varied plant diversity levels to evaluate the relationships between soil bacterial and fungal diversity, rare taxa, and soil multifunctionality in a semi-arid grassland. We used Illumina HiSeq sequencing to determine soil bacterial and fungal diversity and evaluated soil functions associated with the nutrient cycle. We found that high diversity plant assemblages had a higher ratio of below-ground biomass to above-ground biomass, soil multifunctionality, and lower microbial carbon limitation than those with low diversity. Moreover, the fungal richness was negatively and significantly associated with microbial carbon limitations. The fungal richness was positively related to soil multifunctionality, but the bacterial richness was not. We also found that the relative abundance of saprotrophs was positively correlated with soil multifunctionality, and the relative abundance of pathogens was negatively correlated with soil multifunctionality. In addition, the rare fungal taxa played a disproportionate role in regulating soil multifunctionality. Structural equation modeling showed that the shift of plant biomass allocation patterns increased plant below-ground biomass in the highly diverse plant plots, which can alleviate soil microbial carbon limitations and enhance the fungal richness, thus promoting soil multifunctionality. Overall, these findings expand our comprehensive understanding of the critical role of soil fungal diversity and rare taxa in regulating soil multifunctionality under global plant diversity loss scenarios.",###,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology11060870,195,Jana,,No,"no management (no agriculture?), no manipulation, just selected plant patches with one or multiple species in a grassland",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sixteen farms rearing the dual-purpose Rendena breed were assessed for global warming potential, acidification and eutrophication impacts through the Life Cycle Assessment method in two scenarios: the Baseline Scenario based on the actual farm data and the Milk-Beef production system Scenario assuming that calves exceeding the culling rate were fattened directly on-farm. Three different emissions allocation methods were considered: No allocation; Physical allocation, which also accounted for the co-product beef; and Economic allocation, which also accounted for the ecosystem services provided by the farms and were estimated on the basis of agri-environmental payments. Furthermore, two functional units were used: fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM) and utilizable agricultural land (UAL). Within the Baseline Scenario and with FPCM as the functional unit, performing No allocation, the mean values obtained for the global warming potential, acidification and eutrophication were 1.43 kg CO2-eq/kg FPCM, 25.84 g SO2-eq/kg FPCM and 3.99 g PO43- - eq/kg FPCM, respectively. The organic farms had a significantly lower eutrophication impact than the conventional farms considering all three allocation methods. Conversely, if UAL was used as the functional unit, the mean values obtained for the global warming potential, acidification and eutrophication were 0.80 kg CO2-eq/m(2),14.28 g SO2-eq/m(2) and 2.32 g PO43- eq/m(2), respectively. The Milk-Beef production system Scenario increased emissions per m(2) of UAL, but it reduced the emissions apportioned to 1 kg of FPCM, with stronger trends in the organic farms because of the increased added value of the meat production. This study highlights how strengthening beef production in dual-purpose breeds reduced the emissions apportioned to milk and suggests an approach to acknowledge multi-functionality considering some of the ecosystem services provided by the farms.

Revealing ecological stability of belowground organisms is key to developing management strategies that maintain agricultural ecosystem services in a changing world. Here, we collected soils from adjacent pairs of maize and rice fields along large spatial scale across Eastern and Southeast China to investigate the importance of core microbiota as a predictor of resistance of soil microbiome (e.g. bacteria, fungi and protist) to climate changes and nutrient fertilization, and their effect on multiple ecosystem functions, representing key services for crop growth and health in agro-ecosystems. Soil microbiome in maize soils exhibited stronger resistance than that in rice soils, by considering multiple aspects of the resistance index, for example, community, phylogenetic conservation and network complexity. Community resistance of soil microbiome showed a geographic pattern, with higher resistance at lower latitudes, suggesting their stronger resistance in warmer regions. Particularly, we highlighted the role of core phylotypes in enhancing the community resistance of soil microbiome, which was essential for the maintenance of multifunctionality in agricultural ecosystems. Our results represent a significant advance in linking core phylotypes to community resistance and ecosystem functions, and therefore forecasting agro-ecosystems dynamics in response to ongoing environmental changes. These suggest that core phylotypes should be considered a key factor in enhancing agricultural sustainability and crop productivity under global change scenarios.",###,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.16387,199,Jana,,No,"no management effects measured or tested, no diversity (just resistance of community composition/network complexity)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, our understanding is limited concerning the relative importance of different plant traits for soil functions and of the mechanisms by which traits influence soil properties in the real world. Here we test the hypothesis that taller species, or those with complex rooting structures, are associated with high rates of nutrient and carbon (C) cycling in grassland. We further hypothesized that communities dominated by species with deeper roots may be more resilient to drought. These hypotheses were tested in a 3-yr grassland restoration experiment on degraded ex-arable land in southern England. We sowed three trait-based plant functional groups, assembled using database derived values of plant traits, and their combinations into bare soil. This formed a range of plant trait syndromes onto which we superimposed a simulated drought 2yr after initial establishment. We found strong evidence that community weighted mean (CWM) of plant height is negatively associated with soil nitrogen cycling and availability and soil multifunctionality. We propose that this was due to an exploitative resource capture strategy that was inappropriate in shallow chalk soils. Further, complexity of root architecture was positively related to soil multifunctionality throughout the season, with fine fibrous roots being associated with greater rates of nutrient cycling. Drought resistance of soil functions including ecosystem respiration, mineralization, and nitrification were positively related to functional divergence of rooting depth, indicating that, in shallow chalk soils, a range of water capture strategies is necessary to maintain functions. Finally, after 3yr of the experiment, we did not detect any links between the plant traits and microbial communities, supporting the finding that traits based on plant structure and resource foraging capacity are the main variables driving soil function in the early years of grassland conversion. We suggest that screening recently restored grassland communities for potential soil multifunctionality and drought resilience may be possible based on rooting architecture and plant height. These results indicate that informed assembly of plant communities based on plant traits could aid in the restoration of functioning in degraded soil.",###,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2437,200,Jana,,No,"No diversity effects tested but rather functional composition (trait CWM), functions and multifunctionality are soil related",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

UGI can be understood as a multifunctional network of different urban green spaces and elements contributing to urban benefits. Urban agriculture has gained increasing research interest in this context. While a strong focus has been made on functions and benefits of small scale activities, the question is still open, whether these findings can be up-scaled and transferred to the farmland scale. Furthermore, multifunctionality of urban and pert-urban agriculture is rarely being considered in the landscape context. This research aims to address these gaps and harnesses the question if agricultural landscapes - which in many European metropolitan regions provide significant spatial potential - can contribute to UGI as multifunctional green spaces. This work considers multifunctionality qualitatively based on stakeholder opinion, using a participatory research approach. This study provides new insights in pert-urban farmland potentials for UGI development, resulting into a strategy framework. Furthermore, it reflects on the role of the stakeholder involvement for multifunctionality planning'. It suggests that it helps to define meaningful bundles of intertwined functions that interact on different scales, helping to deal with non-linearity of multiple functions and to better manage them simultaneously.",###,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2018.07.012,201,Jana,,No,"No diversity, modelling paper",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The complexity of interaction among ecological, economic and political variables and a widespread lack of data availability lead to difficulty in bringing together large scale analysis and local planning systems. This loop can be solved through flexible tools able to relate large scale environmental assessment with medium and small scale DSS, useful for local decisions makers. The present research aims at creating a spatial model, based on Geographic Information Systems (GISs), capable to quantify the potential amount of woody biomass from forest sector at several evaluation scales, to consider the theoretical impact of biomass removal on forest multifunctionality and to estimate the potential trade-off between forest functions in case of bioenergy chain development. The model is carried out basing on multifunctionality aspects and their potential relationship with biomass energy production. The forest functions considered in the model are: (i) soil and water protection, (ii) biodiversity and habitat conservation, (iii) fire risk prevention, (iv) tourist and recreational function and (v) economic evaluation related to timber and bioenergy processing. The structure of the model is based on sub-models that enable biomass chain analysis from large scale to small scale. Large scale analysis is developed using forest yield data, protected areas and main and forest roads localization, geomorphological variables and fire risk maps. An increase of input data (economic and logistic variables) is requested for medium and small scale analysis. The model is tested from national (Italy) to regional (Tuscany region in Central Italy) and provincial scale (province of Trento in North-Eastern Italian Alps). Results stress how the model can be able to depict territorial differences in several contexts and to consider respective influence on estimation of biomass availability. Finally, the Compromise Programming (CP) methodology permits defining the optimal quantity of residues removal in different compartments according to priority forest function. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this model is to assess the multifunctional performance of olive growing at farm-level according to the farming techniques implemented by olive growers, as land managers, in average conditions of olive cultivation in Andalusia. The proposed model is theoretically based on the Analytic Network Process (ANP), a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis method. The model is built on the knowledge of 27 experts and an extensive review of the international literature, and it draws from empirical data gathered from a survey of 400 farmers in the main olive oil producing zones of Andalusia. The application of the model is illustrated with a view to improving olive growing agri-environmental policies oriented to multifunctionality in Andalusia. The modelling results indicate that, in general, olive growers are applying technical alternatives which are optimal for obtaining a high quality product, but to a certain extent they are neglecting the social impacts and, to an even greater extent, the environmental impacts of their activity. Despite the positive evolution over the last decade, there is still much room for improvement. The most sensitive groups of farming practices generally in need of changes are soil management, irrigation and fertilization. The results also make it clear that an improved economic performance is not incompatible with social objectives, such as rural development and employment, and with the environmental protection of soil, water and biodiversity. Finally, the results indicate the higher multifunctional performance of some alternative farming packs. This is the case for both integrated production and intensive agriculture.
